	Abstract = {Recently, hybrid maps that combine metric and topological world information have been proposed as a powerful representation of mobile robot environments. Among others, these maps are of special interest for efficiently managing large-scale environments, and for accurate localization. For achieving that, local geometric maps are stored in the nodes of a graph-based global map. In this paper we present a novel approach for automatically obtaining those local maps from observations. The method considers the space sensed in each observation as a node of a graph with arcs representing the space overlap between observations. The recursive partition (cut) of this graph produces groups of strongly connected nodes from which consistent local maps for accurate localization are derived. The proposed partition technique is well-grounded in the spectral graph theory of, and it is formulated for any type of sensor observation. We depict an implementation for grouping 2D laser scans, and show experimental results with real data that demonstrate the performance of the method
},
	Annote = {This paper uses NGC to partition a full SLAM solution according to minimizing the "SSO" : Sensed Space Overlap.  This metric is how much of the sensor is overlapping with the other pose's sensor reading, how redundant is this other pose.  It has a value of 1 on the same pose, and it is symmetric and nonnegative.  It is used as the metric to set the values of the edge weights for NGC (normalised graph cuts).},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that pursues robustness and accuracy in large-scale environments. Like most successful works on SLAM, we use Bayesian filtering to provide a probabilistic estimation that can cope with uncertainty in the measurements, the robot pose, and the map. Our approach is based on the reconstruction of the robot path in a hybrid discrete-continuous state space, which naturally combines metric and topological maps. There are two fundamental characteristics that set this paper apart from previous ones: 1) the use of a unified Bayesian inference approach both for the metrical and the topological parts of the problem and 2) the analytical formulation of belief distributions over hybrid maps, which allows us to maintain the spatial uncertainty in large spaces more accurately and efficiently than in previous works. We also describe a practical implementation that aims for real-time operation. Our ideas have been validated by promising experimental results in large environments (up to 30 000 m2, a 2 km robot path) with multiple nested loops, which could hardly be managed appropriately by other approaches.},

@article{Lowe04IJCV,
	Abstract = {The purpose of the SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) is to extract distinctive invariant features which allow for matching between different views of an object.  The features are invariant to scale and rotation, while remaining robust to illumination, noise, change in viewpoint, and illumination.  The features are distinctive enough to be matched uniquely among a large database of features with high probability of detection.

Recognition is handled by a nearest-neighbor algorithm with a generalized Hough transform to make sure the features agree on a single object location plus another verification step.

The first stage searches over scales and locations to find "scale-space extrema".  This is approximated by the Difference of Gaussians function to identify these interest points.

These keypoints are then selected from the extrema of the scale-space which are stable among scales and location within the scale-space.  An orientation is assigned to the keypoints based on image gradient directions.  The orientation invariance is achieved by computing all quantities relative to this keypoint orientation; therefore all quantities are in a local frame-of-reference.

The descriptor is computed at the keypoint location by rotating the local gradient image into the zero orientation.  The feature vector is a 4x4 set of 8 histogram bins for orientations, which gives 128 entries.  This vector is then normalized to unit length to assist with illumination invariance.

The authors speak of having a 50% recognition rate in their tests when the sample object undergoes a 50 degree rotation out-of-the-plane.},

@article{Marzorati07ECMR,
	Annote = {This paper describes a visual SLAM system which uses "hierarchical map decomposition" and 6DoF pose by fusing measurements from line detectors and point features.  This fusion is accomplished through the use of the Uncertain Projective Geometry framework: by representing a line as an operator on two points, and a plane as a 3D point plus a 3d line they are able to determine the Jacobians of these operators directly since they are bilinear.  The simplest example which I will note here which is seen on the second page, two 2D points giving a 2D line.  The relation is the wedge operator between these points, which can be written in matrix form as S(x)y where S(x) is the cross product matrix of X.  Taking the matrix-vector product of S(x) and y gives a line vector [y1-y2, x2-x1, x1y2-x2y1] which if you take the homogenous representation of a point you can test to see how far it is from this line through the inner product operator.

Lines are represented using the 6 parameter Plucker form (umlaut on the u) which is the homogenous equivalent of a 3D line, expressed in 5D projective geometry(!).  It uniquely determines the line through two points x, and y as d=y-x and m = x(cross)y with Plucker coordinates of (d1,d2,d3, m1,m2,m3).  Check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_geometry

The use of these operators gives their Jacobians directly for use on the covariance propogation in the EKF.  This is because they are using both point estimates of the endpoints of the lines as well as line estimates, and both must be used to update the covariances of the line parameters.},

The general problem is NP-hard, but our algorithm produces an approximate solution in O(N2) time by considering the spectral properties of the graph's adjacency matrix. We show how this algorithm can be used to find sets of self-consistent hypotheses while rejecting incorrect hypotheses, a problem that frequently arises in robotics. We present results from a range-only SLAM system, a polynomial time data association algorithm, and a method for parametric line fitting that can outperform RANSAC.},

@article{Smith06BMVC,
	Annote = {This paper describes using line features in a 6DOF Visual SLAM.  The paper argues that using Canny with Hough would be too slow for extracting lines in the image -- however they may not know about the OpenCV implementations judging from their use of archaic Oxford computer vision libraries.  First they describe their line detector which uses the "FAST" feature detector to locate candidate line endpoints.  This generates about 166 corners on a 320x240 image.  Now each pair of endpoints is tested to see if it is a line.  this is 13695 possible lines, but they are pruned with some simple tests
1) Must be longer than 30 pixels
2) Midpoint is tested with Sobel operator for "edgel"ness with a generous threshold
3) 1/4 and 3/4 point is tested for "edgel"ness
4) Full Bressenham walk is tested for "edgel"ness, must have >= 95% edgels
Whole process takes 4.4ms

Measurements are made along the normal direction to the line due to the aperture problem.  Lines are represented using the end points as point features, which allows a simple form for all of the Jacobians.  only slight changes from the single point feature case, designed to restrict the innovation to the normal direction.  Partially initialized features are kept as semi-infinite planes which are represented with the particle filter until they collapse into a line estimate.  though this is probably really two particle filters on the endpoints of the line.  Measurement is taken as a point sample along the projected line, this sample traverses along the 1D projected normal direction to find the nearest good edgel, with some robustness to generate a consistant estimate from all point samples.  This error is propogated in the measurement update step while maintaining that it is only along the normal direction.

Main result: twice the performance of point features in terms of longevity of consistency, though this is still a pitiful longevity of only 26 seconds.  Davison uses no odometry so this will presumably be a severe limiting factor.},
