  Abstract =	 {This paper considers the distributed data fusion
                  (DDF) problem for general multi-agent robotic sensor
                  net-works in applications such as 3D mapping and
                  target search. In particular, this paper focuses on
                  the use of conservative fusion via the weighted
                  exponential product (WEP) rule to combat
                  inconsistencies that arise from double-counting
                  common information between fusion agents. WEP fusion
                  is ideal for fusing arbitrarily distributed
                  estimates in ad-hoc communication network
                  topologies, but current WEP rule variants have
                  limited applicability to general multi-robot DDF. To
                  address these issues, new information-theoretic WEP
                  metrics are presented along with novel optimization
                  algorithms for efficiently performing DDF within a
                  recursive Bayesian estimation framework. While the
                  proposed WEP fusion methods are generalizable to
                  arbitrary probability distribution functions (pdfs),
                  emphasis is placed here on widely-used Bernoulli and
                  Gaussian mixture pdfs. Experimental results for
                  multi-robot 3D mapping and target search
                  applications show the effectiveness of the proposed
                  methods.},

  Abstract =	 {We discuss a general message passing algorithm,
                  which we call the generalized distributive law
                  (GDL). The GDL is a synthesis of the work of many
                  authors in information theory, digital
                  communications, signal processing, statistics and
                  artificial intelligence. It includes as special
                  cases the Baum-Welch algorithm, the fast Fourier
                  transform (FFT) on any finite Abelian group, the
                  Gallager-Tanner-Wiberg decoding algorithm, Viterbi's
                  algorithm, the BCJR algorithm, Pearl's "belief
                  propagation" algorithm, the Shafer-Shenoy
                  probability propagation algorithm, and the turbo
                  decoding algorithm. Although this algorithm is
                  guaranteed to give exact answers only in certain
                  cases (the "junction tree" condition), unfortunately
                  not including the cases of GTW with cycles or turbo
                  decoding, there is much experimental evidence, and a
                  few theorems, suggesting that it often works
                  approximately even when it is not supposed to.},

                  function. Factor graphs may be viewed as an
                  alternative approach with closer ties to Tanner
                  graphs and previously developed graphical
                  representations for codes. Es- sentially, every

                  may be translated into an equivalent result in the

                  thing \citep{Frey96ccc,Aji00it}. In particular, the
                  example of iterative decoding proved that
                  probability propagation, which had been used only
                  for cycle-free graphs, could be used also for graphs

@article{Aloimonos88ijcv,
  Abstract =	 {We investigate several basic problems in vision
                  under the assumption that the observer is active. An
                  observer is called active when engaged in some kind
                  of activity whose purpose is to control the
                  geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus. The
                  purpose of the activity is to manipulate the
                  constraints underlying the observed phenomena in
                  order to improve the quality of the perceptual
                  results. For example a monocular observer that moves
                  with a known or unknown motion or a binocular
                  observer that can rotate his eyes and track
                  environmental objects are just two examples of an
                  observer that we call active. We prove that an
                  active observer can solve basic vision problems in a
                  much more efficient way than a passive one. Problems
                  that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a passive
                  observer become well-posed and linear for an active
                  observer. In particular, the problems of shape from
                  shading and depth computation, shape from contour,
                  shape from texture, and structure from motion are
                  shown to be much easier for an active observer than
                  for a passive one. It has to be emphasized that
                  correspondence is not used in our approach, i.e.,
                  active vision is not correspondence of features from
                  multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here
                  does not mean active sensing, and this paper
                  introduces a general methodology, a general
                  framework in which we believe low-level vision
                  problems should be addressed.},

                  questioned (Aloimonos et al., 1988; Bajcsy,
                  1988). Noting that biological vision is purposive
                  and active, researchers proposed that computer
                  vision too should aim at serving certain well-de ned
                  goals such as navigation or recognition rather than
                  at constructing a general-purpose representation of
                  the world.},

                  algorithm for preordering a symmetric sparse matrix
                  prior to numerical factorization is presented. We
                  use techniques based on the quotient graph for
                  matrix factorization that allow us to obtain
                  computationally cheap bounds for the minimum
                  degree. We show that these bounds are often equal to
                  the actual degree. The resulting algorithm is
                  typically much faster than previous minimum degree
                  ordering algorithms and produces results that are
                  comparable in quality with the best orderings from

  Abstract =	 {In the present study we assessed the use of
                  landmarks and scene layout information for the
                  control of locomotion. Observers were presented
                  displays simulating forward locomotion through a
                  random dot field with the horizontal position
                  perturbed by a sum-of-sines function and were asked
                  to steer and null out the horizontal disturbance of
                  the path of locomotion. The results indicate greater
                  control gain and accuracy when presented with a
                  repeating layout of landmarks as compared to a
                  changing layout of landmarks. Debriefing responses
                  suggest that observers may have implicitly learned
                  the layout of the repeating pattern. These results
                  suggest that observers use an allocentric
                  representation of the scene for steering control. A
                  model for the control of locomotion is discussed
                  that utilizes both scene-based information and optic
                  flow.},

  Abstract =	 {We describe a probabilistic framework for detection
                  and modeling of doors from sensor data acquired in
                  corridor environments with mobile robots. The
                  framework captures shape, color, and motion
                  properties of door and wall objects. The
                  probabilistic model is optimized with a version of
                  the expectation maximization algorithm, which
                  segments the environment into door and wall objects
                  and learns their properties. The framework allows
                  the robot to generalize the properties of detected
                  object instances to new object instances. We
                  demonstrate the algorithm on real-world data
                  acquired by a Pioneer robot equipped with a laser
                  range finder and an omni-directional camera. Our
                  results show that our algorithm reliably segments
                  the environment into walls and doors, finding both
                  doors that move and doors that do not move. We show
                  that our approach achieves better results than
                  models that only capture behavior, or only capture
                  appearance.},

  Abstract =	 {The use of a fleet of highly synchronized spacecraft
                  to synthesize a space-based optical interferometer,
                  as envisioned by the TPF mission of NASA Origins
                  program, will allow for baselines large enough to
                  achieve milli-arcsecond resolutions. We explore the
                  use of the covariance intersection (CI) algorithm
                  for state estimation of distributed spacecraft. The
                  CI algorithm provides a mechanism for fusing two or
                  more random variables with unknown cross-covariance
                  such that the computed covariance of the new
                  estimate is consistent. We consider the case of five
                  spacecraft with a decentralized estimation scheme
                  where each spacecraft shares its own estimates with
                  the rest of the fleet using a ring-type
                  communication architecture. This simplified scenario
                  of the TPF mission is used to highlight the problems
                  that can originate if the cross-covariances are
                  completely ignored. The result shows that the CI
                  filter performance instead is not affected and
                  provides good estimates},

  Abstract =	 {We propose a generic grouping algorithm that
                  constructs a hierarchy of regions from the output of
                  any contour detector. Our method consists of two
                  steps, an oriented watershed transform (OWT) to form
                  initial regions from contours, followed by
                  construction of an ultra-metric contour map (UCM)
                  defining a hierarchical segmentation. We provide
                  extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate
                  that, when coupled to a high-performance contour
                  detector, the OWT-UCM algorithm produces
                  state-of-the-art image segmentations. These

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we present a new method for
                  vision-based, reactive robot navigation that enables
                  a robot to move in the middle of the free space by
                  exploiting both central and peripheral vision. The
                  robot employs a forward-looking camera for central
                  vision and two side-looking cameras for sensing the
                  periphery of its visual field. The developed method
                  combines the information acquired by this trinocular
                  vision system and produces low-level motor commands
                  that keep the robot in the middle of the free
                  space. The approach follows the purposive vision
                  paradigm in the sense that vision is not studied in
                  isolation but in the context of the behaviors that
                  the system is engaged as well as the environment and
                  the robot's motor capabilities. It is demonstrated
                  that by taking into account these issues, vision
                  processing can be drastically simplified still
                  giving rise to quite complex behaviors. The proposed
                  method does not make strict assumptions about the
                  environment, requires very low level information to
                  be extracted from the images, produces a robust
                  robot behavior and is computationally
                  efficient. Results obtained by bath simulations and
                  from a prototype on-line implementation demonstrate
                  the effectiveness of the method},

  Abstract =	 {Artificial navigation systems stand to benefit
                  greatly from learning maps of visual environments,
                  but traditional map-making techniques are inadequate
                  in several respects. This paper describes an
                  adaptive, view-based, relational map-making system
                  for navigating within a 3D environment defined by a
                  spatially distributed set of visual
                  landmarks. Inspired by an analogy to learning aspect
                  graphs of 3D objects, the system comprises two
                  neurocomputational architectures that emulate
                  cognitive mapping in the rat hippocampus. The first
                  architecture performs unsupervised place learning by
                  combining the ?hat?with the ?here? namely through
                  conjunctions of landmark identity, pose, and
                  egocentric gaze direction within a local, restricted
                  sensory view of the environment. The second
                  associatively learns action consequences by
                  incorporating the ?hen? namely through conjunctions
                  of learned places and coarsely coded robot
                  motions. Together, these networks form a map
                  reminiscent of a partially observable Markov
                  decision process, and consequently provide an ideal
                  neural substrate for prediction, environment
                  recognition, route planning, and
                  exploration. Preliminary results from real-time
                  implementations on a mobile robot called MAVIN (the
                  Mobile Adaptive VIsual Navigator) demonstrate the

  Abstract =	 {In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots
                  obtain range and/or angle measurements to each other
                  and dead-reckoning information to help each other
                  navigate more accurately. One typical approach is
                  moving baseline navigation, in which multiple
                  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) exchange range
                  measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile
                  trilateration. While the sharing of information
                  between vehicles can be highly beneficial,
                  exchanging measurements and state estimates can also
                  be dangerous because of the risk of measurements
                  being used by a vehicle more than once; such data
                  re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident)
                  estimates, making data association and outlier
                  rejection more difficult and divergence more
                  likely. In this paper, we present a technique for
                  the consistent cooperative localization of multiple
                  AUVs performing mobile trilateration. Each AUV
                  establishes a bank of filters, performing careful
                  bookkeeping to track the origins of measurements and
                  prevent the use any of the measurements more than
                  once. The multiple estimates are combined in a
                  consistent manner, yielding conservative covariance
                  estimates. The technique is illustrated using
                  simulation results. The new method is compared
                  side-by-side with a naive approach that does not
                  keep track of the origins of measurements,
                  illustrating that the new method keeps conservative
                  covariance bounds whereas state estimates obtained
                  with the naive approach become overconfident and
                  diverge.},

  Abstract =	 {A new method is described for automatically
                  reconstructing 3D planar faces from multiple images
                  of a scene. The novelty of the approach lies in the
                  use of inter-image homographies to validate and best
                  estimate the plane, and in the minimal
                  initialization requirements-only a single 3D line
                  with a textured neighbourhood is required to
                  generate a plane hypothesis. The planar facets
                  enable line grouping and also the construction of
                  parts of the wireframe which were missed due to the
                  inevitable shortcomings of feature detection and
                  matching. The method allows a piecewise planar model
                  of a scene to be built completely automatically,
                  with no user intervention at any stage, given only
                  the images and camera projection matrices as
                  input. The robustness and reliability of the method
                  are illustrated on several examples, from both

  Abstract =	 {Active Perception (Active Vision specifically) is
                  defined as a study of Modeling and Control
                  strategies for perception. By modeling we mean
                  models of sensors, processing modules and their
                  interaction. We distinguish local models from global
                  models by their extent of application in space and
                  time. The local models represent procedures and
                  parameters such as optical distortions of the lens,
                  focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter,
                  etc. The global models on the other hand
                  characterize the overall performance and make
                  predictions on how the individual modules
                  interact. The control strategies are formulated as a
                  search of such sequence of steps that would minimize

  Abstract =	 {To ambulate in an urban environment, we face the
                  management of many simultaneous tasks, such as
                  walking on a sidewalk, avoiding pedestrians, and
                  crossing busy streets. The management of
                  simultaneous tasks has been studied extensively, but
                  those studies tend to focus on attentional loading
                  in reaction time experiments that use stimulus
                  presentations of less than one second. As a result,
                  little is known about how attention is managed in
                  extended natural tasks that take on the order of
                  many minutes. The current study addresses the
                  extended allocation of visual attention. We study
                  the gaze control and locomotion control for a
                  virtual humanoid agent walking in a realistic
                  simulated urban world. The agent��? behaviors are
                  directed by visuo-motor routines that each handle a
                  single well-defined task, such as staying on the
                  sidewalk or avoiding an obstacle. The key element in
                  our model is that behaviors ask for and are given
                  access to the body on a probabilistic basis. The
                  probabilities are continually adjusted to reflect
                  the contingencies produced by the environment. The
                  gaze access period is adjusted to reflect the modal
                  time of human fixations in similar tasks. The
                  locomotion access period is adjusted to fit human
                  performance data. Such a model can explain how
                  different behaviors can compete for both eye gaze
                  resources in addition to locomotion resources of the
                  body in a seamless manner. In our simulation, the
                  humanoid walks along a crowded sidewalk and crosses
                  streets. During this time the instantaneous
                  allocation of resources to gaze and ambulation are
                  recorded. To test our model, we have human subjects
                  doing the same task. Humans wear head-mounted
                  displays that allow them to navigate in the same
                  virtual environment. Six-dof head-tracking as well
                  as eye-tracking in the HMD allows us to compare the
                  use of gaze and locomotion by the human subjects
                  with our model. Our initial results suggest that the
                  probabilistic allocation of resources is a good fit
                  to the human data.},

  Abstract =	 {Animate vision systems have gaze control mechanisms
                  that can actively position the camera coordinate
                  systemin response to physical stimuli. Compared to
                  passive systems, animate systems show that visual
                  computation can be vastly less expensive when
                  considered in the larger context of behavior. The
                  most important visual behavior is the ability to
                  control the direction of gaze. This allows the use
                  of very low resolution imaging that has a high
                  virtual resolution. Using such a system in a
                  controlled way provides additional constraints that
                  dramatically simplify the computations of early
                  vision. Another important behavior is the way the
                  environment "behaves." Animate systems under
                  real-time constraints can further reduce their
                  computational burden by using environmental cues
                  that are perspicuous in the local context. A third
                  source of economy is introduced when behaviors are
                  learned. Because errors are rarely fatal, systems
                  using learning algorithms can amortize computational
                  cost over extended periods. Further economies can be
                  achieved when the learning system uses indexical
                  reference, which is a form of dynamic variable
                  binding. Animate vision is a natural way of
                  implementing this dynamic binding.},

                  argues that vision is more readily understood in the
                  context of the visual behaviors that the system is
                  engaged in, and that these behaviors may not require
                  elaborate categorical representations of the 3-D
                  world. .. The human eye is distinguished from
                  current electronic cameras by virtue of having much
                  better resolution in a small region near the optical
                  axis. .. With the small fovea at a premium in a
                  large visual field, it is not surprising that the
                  human visual system has special behaviors (saccades)
                  for quickly moving the fovea to different spatial
                  targets. .. Furthermore most of the brain structures
                  that represent visual information are retinally
                  indexed. This means that their state is changed with
                  each eye movement This raises a technical puzzle for
                  human visual perception: How can the world appear to
                  be stable when the data collecting process is so
                  dynamic? We believe that this is a profound question
                  with a surprising answer: The visual system provides
                  the illusion of three-dimensional stability by
                  virtue of being able to execute fast
                  behaviors. .. The central asset of animate vision is
                  gaze control. Gaze control is the collection of
                  different mechanisms for keeping the fovea over a
                  given spatial target. The single most distinguishing
                  feature of the human visual system is its high-speed
                  gaze control mechanisms. .. Gaze control mechanisms
                  fundamentally change computational models of
                  vision. [] With them a new paradigm emerges in which
                  the visual calculations are embedded in a
                  sensory-motor behavioral repertoire. .. This
                  viewpoint has many different kinds of advantages. 1)
                  Animate vision systems can use physical
                  search. []. 2) Animate vision can make
                  (approximately) known camera movements. []. 3)
                  Animate vision can use exocentric coordinate
                  frames. [] 4) Animate vision can use relative (or
                  qualitative) algorithms. [] 5) Gaze control can
                  segment areas of interest in the image
                  pre-categorically. [] 6) Animate systems can exploit
                  environmental context. [] 7) Animate vision is
                  tailor-made/or learning algorithms that use
                  indexical reference. .. We further suggest that very
                  different algorithms are used depending on the task
                  of the moment. A gross distinction that can be made
                  is between identification algorithms that analyze
                  the foveated area during fixation and location
                  algorithms that direct the eyes to new
                  targets. .. Why should the primate brain be
                  specialized into two separate areas that are crucial
                  for different functions? If we think generally about
                  the problem of relating internal models to objects
                  in the world, then one way to interpret this
                  dichotomy is as a suggestion that the general
                  problem of associating many models to many parts of
                  the image simultaneously is too difficult. In order
                  to make it computationally tractable within a single
                  fixation, it has to be simplified, either into one
                  of location (one internal model) or identification
                  (one world object).},

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a technique to estimate the 3D
                  motion of a vehicle using odometric sensors and a
                  stereo camera. The algorithm falls into the category
                  of simultaneous localization and mapping as a large
                  database of visual landmarks is created. The
                  algorithm has been eld tested online on a rover
                  traversing loose terrain in the presence of
                  obstacles. The resulting position estimation errors
                  are between 0.5\% and 4\% of distance travelled, a
                  significant improvement over odometry alone.},

                  associative search task and describe the behavior of
                  an adaptive network capable of solving it. This
                  example shows how naturally the associative search
                  problem can arise and permits the search,
                  association, and generalization properties of the

  Abstract =	 { In this paper, we investigate the problem of the
                  automatic creation of 3D models of man-made
                  environments that we represent as collections of
                  textured planes. A typical approach is to
                  automatically compute a sparse feature
                  reconstruction and to manually give their
                  plane-memberships as well as the delineation of the
                  planes. Textures are then extracted from the images
                  while optimizing the model, typically the disparity
                  between marked and predicted edges. We propose a
                  means to automatically estimate the model of the
                  scene, in terms of the number of planes and their
                  parameters from a point feature reconstruction. The
                  method is based on random sampling of reconstructed
                  points to generate plane hypotheses. Each of these
                  is then evaluated using a measure of approximate
                  photoconsistency while recovering the corresponding
                  plane delineation. We then compute the maximum
                  likelihood estimate of all scene parameters,
                  i.e. the set of planes and reconstructed points as
                  well as relative camera pose, with respect to actual
                  images. The approach is validated on simulated data
                  and real images.},

  Abstract =	 {We describe an algorithm for robot navigation using
                  a Sensor network embedded in the environment. Sensor
                  nodes act as signposts for the robot to follow, thus
                  obviating the need for a map or localization on the
                  part of the robot Navigation directions are computed
                  within the network (not on the robot) using value
                  iteration. Using small low-power radios, the robot
                  communicates with nodes in the network locally, and
                  makes navigation decisions based on which node it is
                  near. An algorithm based on processing of radio
                  signal strength data was developed so the robot
                  could succcessfully decide which node neighborhood
                  it belonged to. Extensive experiments with a robot
                  and a sensor network confirm the validity of the

  Abstract =	 {Demonstrates a method of using non-metric visual
                  information derived from an uncalibrated active
                  vision system to navigate an autonomous vehicle
                  through free-space regions detected in a cluttered
                  environment. The structure of 3-space is recovered
                  modulo an affine transformation using an
                  uncalibrated active stereo head carried by the
                  vehicle. The plane at infinity, necessary for
                  recovering affine structure from projective
                  structure, is found in a novel manner by making
                  controlled rotations of the head. The structure is
                  composed of 3D points obtained by detecting and
                  matching image corners through the stereo image
                  sequence. Considerable care has been taken to ensure
                  that the processing is reliable, robust and
                  automatic. Driveable regions are determined from the
                  projection of the affine structure onto a plane
                  parallel to the ground determined using projective
                  constructs. Two methods of negotiating the regions
                  are explored. The first introduces metric
                  information to allow control of a Euclidean
                  vehicle. The second uses visual servoing of the
                  active head to navigate in the affinely described

  Abstract =	 {There is a class of database descriptions, involving
                  one "acyclic" join dependency and a collection of
                  functional dependencies, and nothing else, that
                  appears powerful enough to describe most any
                  real-world body of data in relational database
                  terms. Further, this class has many desirable
                  properties. Some properties make operations like
                  updates and the selection of joins to implement a
                  query over a universal relation especially
                  easy. Other properties of interest were studied by
                  other researchers who described the same class in
                  radically different terms, and found desirable
                  properties in their own contexts. It is the purpose
                  of this paper to define the class formally, to give
                  its important properties and the equivalences with
                  the other classes mentioned, and to explain the
                  importance of each property. This paper is intended
                  to summarize the results that will appear in more

                  sample algorithm for determining acyclicty is

                  robot-independent ontology and logical theory for
                  building topological maps of large-scale
                  environments online. Existing SSH implementations
                  make very limited use of perceptual information and
                  thus create many candidate maps. Metrical mapping
                  implementations capture detailed knowledge about
                  local small-scale space but do not handle large
                  environments well due to computational limitations
                  and global metrical uncertainty. In this paper, we
                  extend the SSH to utilize better sensory information
                  by incorporating information derived from local
                  metrical models into the large-scale space

  Abstract =	 {A map is a description of an environment allowing an
                  agent---a human, or in our case a mobile robot---to
                  plan and perform effective actions. From a single
                  location, an agent's sensors can not observe the
                  whole structure of a complex, large environment. For
                  this reason, the agent must build a map from
                  observations gathered over time and space. We
                  distinguish between large-scale space, with spatial
                  structure larger than the agent's sensory horizon,
                  and small-scale space, with structure within the
                  sensory horizon. We propose a factored approach to
                  mobile robot map-building that handles qualitatively
                  different types of uncertainty by combining the
                  strengths of topological and metrical
                  approaches. Our framework is based on a
                  computational model of the human cognitive map; thus
                  it allows robust navigation and communication within
                  several different spatial ontologies. Our approach
                  factors the mapping problem into natural sub-goals:
                  building a metrical representation for local
                  small-scale spaces; finding a topological map that
                  represents the qualitative structure of large-scale
                  space; and (when necessary) constructing a metrical
                  representation for large-scale space using the
                  skeleton provided by the topological map. The core
                  contributions of this thesis are a formal
                  description of the Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy
                  (HSSH), a framework for both small-scale and
                  large-scale representations of space, and an
                  implementation of the HSSH that allows a robot to
                  ground the large-scale concepts of place and path in
                  a metrical model of the local surround. Given
                  metrical models of the robot's local surround, we
                  argue that places at decision points in the world
                  can be grounded by the use of a primitive called a
                  gateway. Gateways separate different regions in
                  space and have a natural description at
                  intersections and in doorways. We provide an
                  algorithmic definition of gateways, a theory of how
                  they contribute to the description of paths and
                  places, and practical uses of gateways in spatial
                  mapping and learning. },

  R-Dechter99Ai ={dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization},
  R-Mathscinet = {Dynamic programming involves the decomposition of an
                  optimization problem into a sequence of smaller
                  subproblems. For classical problems, there is a
                  logical order to this sequence, and each subproblem
                  involves only two variables. Nonserial dynamic
                  programming is a generalization of this; typically
                  the decomposition yields subproblems involving three
                  or more variables and there is no logical order to
                  the sequence of these subproblems, but the principle
                  of optimality can still be applied to yield
                  computational savings. This book is a comprehensive
                  study of discrete deterministic nonserial dynamic
                  programming. The emphasis is on the secondary

                  minimize the computational effort. Throughout,

  R-Mathscinet = {Consider an optimization problem without the special
                  serial structure that allows the use of dynamic
                  programming technique. Decomposition can be
                  tried. The optimization problem obtained is called a
                  secondary optimization problem. Let $G=(X,E)$ be an
                  undirected graph without self-loops and parallel
                  edges. Given $x\in X$, the set $T(x)$ is the set of
                  vertices adjacent to $x$. Consider a vertex $y\in
                  X$. The graph obtained from $G$ by (1) deleting $y$
                  and all edges emanating from it and (2) putting an
                  edge between all the pairs of vertices not adjacent
                  in $G$ is called the $y$-elimination graph of $G$
                  and denoted by $G_y$. The operation is called the
                  elimination of the vertex $y$. Call the degree of an
                  eliminated vertex $y_i$ in a given order of
                  elimination $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ the dimension
                  associated with the elimination of the vertex
                  $y_i$. The largest degree of the eliminated vertices
                  for an order of elimination $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ is
                  called the dimension of the order and denoted by
                  $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. The minimal dimension for
                  all possible orders is called the dimension of the
                  graph $G$ and denoted by $D(G)$. The following
                  problem is discussed: Find an ordering of
                  $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ of $X$ which minimizes
                  $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. This is exactly the
                  secondary optimization problem which can be solved
                  considering only the interaction graph of the
                  non-serial problem. There are two algorithms known
                  to solve the secondary optimization problem but they
                  are restricted to problems with 15--20 variables
                  only. Based on two theorems proved in this paper,
                  further computational possibilities are presented,
                  although no formal algorithm is given. The
                  computational significance of the theorems is
                  discussed and demonstrated by some simple
                  examples. Reviewed by D. Hochstadter},

  Abstract =	 {The solution of the segmentation problem requires a
                  mechanism for partitioning the image array into
                  low-level entities based on a model of the
                  underlying image structure. A piecewise-smooth
                  surface model for image data that possesses surface
                  coherence properties is used to develop an algorithm
                  that simultaneously segments a large class of images
                  into regions of arbitrary shape and approximates
                  image data with bivariate functions so that it is
                  possible to compute a complete, noiseless image
                  reconstruction based on the extracted functions and
                  regions. Surface curvature sign labeling provides an
                  initial coarse image segmentation, which is refined
                  by an iterative region-growing method based on
                  variable-order surface fitting. Experimental results
                  show the algorithm's performance on six range images
                  and three intensity images},

  Abstract =	 {We describe an efficient method for localizing a
                  mobile robot in an environment with landmarks. We
                  assume that the robot can identify these landmarks
                  and measure their bearings relative to each
                  other. Given such noisy input, the algorithm
                  estimates the robot? position and orientation with
                  respect to the map of the environment. The algorithm
                  makes efficient use of our representation of the
                  landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in
                  time linear in the number of landmarks. We present
                  results of simulations and propose how to use our
                  method for robot navigation.},

  Abstract =	 {Clique trees and chordal graphs have carved out a
                  niche for themselves in recent work on sparse matrix
                  algorithms, due primarily to research questions
                  associated with advanced computer
                  architectures. This paper is a unified and
                  elementary introduction to the standard
                  characterizations of chordal graphs and clique
                  trees. The pace is leisurely, as detailed proofs of
                  all results are included. We also briefly discuss
                  applications of chordal graphs and clique trees in
                  sparse matrix computations.},

                  introduction of clique trees. Our goal is to provide
                  a unified introduction to chordal graphs and clique
                  trees for those interested in sparse matrix
                  computations, though we hope it will be of use to

                  property: for every vertex v in G, the set of
                  maximal cliques containing v induces a connected
                  subtree of T. Such a tree is called a clique tree,
                  and it can be computed in linear time

  R-Boutilier99Jair ={In a sense, GraphPlan can be viewed as
                  constructing an abstraction in which
                  forward-reachable states are distinguished from
                  unreachable states at each planning stage, and using
                  this distinction among abstract states quickly to
                  identify infeasible regression paths. Note, however,
                  the GraphPlan approximates this distinction by
                  overestimating the set of reachable
                  states. Overestimation (as opposed to
                  underestimation) ensures that the regression search
                  space contains all legitimate plans.},
  R-Hoffmann01Jair ={The first approach was developed by Blum and

                  GRAPHPLAN system (Blum & Furst, 1995), they
                  described a new plan generation technique based on
                  planning graphs, which was much faster than any
                  other technique known at this time.},

                  predefined trajectory. A complete methodology of 3D
                  reconstruction is exposed to perform a dense 3D
                  model with texture mapping. A first result on

  Abstract =	 {We study the satisfiability of randomly generated
                  formulas formed by $M$ clauses of exactly $K$
                  literals over $N$ Boolean variables. For a given
                  value of $N$ the problem is known to be most
                  difficult when $\alpha=M/N$ is close to the
                  experimental threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the
                  region where almost all formulas are SAT from the
                  region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results
                  from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the
                  difficulty is related to the existence of a
                  clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$
                  is close to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$. We
                  introduce a new type of message-passing algorithm
                  which can be used to find efficiently a satisfying
                  assignment of the variables in this difficult
                  region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of
                  two main parts. The first is a message-passing
                  procedure which generalizes the usual methods like
                  sum-product and belief propagation: It passes
                  messages that may be thought of as surveys over
                  clusters of ordinary messages. The second part uses
                  the detailed probabilistic information obtained from
                  the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify
                  the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that
                  remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.},

  Bstract =	 {Consideration is given to the design and application
                  of a recursive algorithm to a sequence of images of
                  a moving object to estimate both its structure and
                  kinematics. The object is assumed to be rigid, and
                  its motion is assumed to be smooth in the sense that
                  it can be modeled by retaining an arbitrary number
                  of terms in the appropriate Taylor series
                  expansions. Translational motion involves a standard
                  rectilinear model, while rotational motion is
                  described with quaternions. Neglected terms of the
                  Taylor series are modeled as process noise. A
                  state-space model is constructed, incorporating both
                  kinematic and structural states, and recursive
                  techniques are used to estimate the state vector as
                  a function of time. A set of object match points is
                  assumed to be available. The problem is formulated
                  as a parameter estimation and tracking problem which
                  can use an arbitrarily large number of images in a
                  sequence. The recursive estimation is done using an
                  iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), initialized
                  with the output of a batch algorithm run on the
                  first few frames. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower
                  bounds on the error covariance of the batch estimate
                  are used as the initial state estimate error
                  covariance of the IEKF. The performance of the
                  recursive estimator is illustrated using both real
                  and synthetic image sequences},

  Abstract =	 {The problem considered involves the use of a
                  sequence of noisy monocular images of a
                  three-dimensional moving object to estimate both its
                  structure and kinematics. The object is assumed to
                  be rigid, and its motion is assumed to be smooth. A
                  set of object match points is assumed to be
                  available, consisting of fixed features on the
                  object, the image plane coordinates of which have
                  been extracted from successive images in the
                  sequence. Structure is defined as the 3-D positions
                  of these object feature points, relative to each
                  other. Rotational motion occurs about the origin of
                  an object-centered coordinate system, while
                  translational motion is that of the origin of this
                  coordinate system. In this work, which is a
                  continuation of the research done by the authors and
                  reported previously (ibid., vol.PAMI-8, p.90-9,
                  Jan. 1986), results of an experiment with real
                  imagery are presented, involving estimation of 28
                  unknown translational, rotational, and structural
                  parameters, based on 12 images with seven feature
                  points.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we consider the problem of exploring
                  an unknown environment by a team of robots. As in
                  single-robot exploration the goal is to minimize the
                  overall exploration time. The key problem to be
                  solved therefore is to choose appropriate target
                  points for the individual robots so that they
                  simultaneously explore different regions of their
                  environment. We present a probabilistic approach for
                  the coordination of multiple robots which, in
                  contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously
                  takes into account the costs of reaching a target
                  point and the utility of target points. The utility
                  of target points is given by the size of the
                  unexplored area that a robot can cover with its
                  sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a
                  target point is assigned to a specific robot, the
                  utility of the unexplored area visible from this
                  target position is reduced for the other
                  robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns
                  different target points to the individual
                  robots. The technique has been implemented and
                  tested extensively in real-world experiments and
                  simulation runs. The results given in this paper
                  demonstrate that our coordination technique
                  significantly reduces the exploration time compared
                  to previous approaches.},

  Abstract =	 {Recent experiments indicate the need for revision of
                  a model of spatial memory consisting of

                  spatial updating and a geometric module for
                  reorientation.  Instead, it appears that both
                  egocentric and allocentric representations exist in
                  parallel, and combine to support behavior according
                  to the task. Current research indicates
                  complementary roles for these representations, with
                  increasing dependence on allocentric representations
                  with the amount of movement between presentation and
                  retrieval, the number of objects remembered, and the
                  size, familiarity and intrinsic structure of the
                  environment. Identifying the neuronal mechanisms and
                  functional roles of each type of representation, and
                  of their interactions, promises to provide a

  Abstract =	 {We present a novel vision-based approach to
                  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We
                  discuss it in the context of estimating the 6 DoF
                  pose of a mobile robot from the perception of a
                  monocular camera using a minimum set of three
                  natural landmarks. In contrast to our previously
                  presented V-GPS system, which navigates based on a
                  set of known landmarks, the current approach allows
                  to estimate the required information about the
                  landmarks on-the-fly during the exploration of an
                  unknown environment The method is applicable to
                  indoor and outdoor environments. The calculation is
                  done from the image position of a set of natural
                  landmarks that are tracked in a continuous video
                  stream at frame-rate. An automatic hand-off process
                  allows an update of the set to compensate for
                  occlusions and decreasing reconstruction accuracies
                  with the distance to an imaged landmark. A generic
                  sensor model allows a system configuration with a
                  variety of physical sensors including: monocular
                  perspective cameras, omni-directional cameras and
                  laser range finders.},

  Abstract =	 {In human vision, sensing is a distinctly dynamic
                  process: the eyes move through an evolving sequence
                  of fixations to explore the visual world, and to
                  selectively gather information critical to the task
                  at hand. Computer vision systems must follow similar
                  smart sensing strategies if they are to perform
                  useful tasks in real time. Through intelligent
                  selection of data at an early analysis stage,
                  systems can reduce the overall computational cost by
                  orders of magnitude. Through smart sensing a vision
                  system makes efficient use of limited computing
                  resources. We have built a machine, based on a
                  pyramid architecture, that supports smart sensing
                  and related highly efficient processing. Key
                  elements of the design are a) hierarchical data
                  structures for image representation, b)
                  fine-to-coarse algorithms for the fast generation of
                  image measures, c) coarse-tofine search strategies
                  that rapidly locate objects or events within a
                  scene, and d) high level control mechanisms that
                  guide data gathering even as visual information is
                  being interpreted. This system, known as the Pyramid
                  Vision Machine, achieves high performance at modest
                  cost. Design considerations and several applications
                  are described here.},

                  own visual experience. Imagine, for example, the
                  driver of a car traveling on a country road. His
                  visual task is to locate and follow the road,
                  observe oncoming traffic, read appropriate road
                  signs, and avoid any objects in the road. To perform
                  this task he does not examine the world in uniform
                  detail. Rather he moves his eyes to fixate in turn
                  certain critical points in the visual field, the
                  road, an oncoming car, a sign. Two or three such
                  fixations per second suffice to drive the car, yet
                  he ?ees?only a minute fraction of the world before

  Abstract =	 {The calculation of probabilities on pedigrees of
                  arbitrary complexity is discussed for a basic model
                  of transmission and penetrance (encompassing
                  Mendelian inheritance, and certain environmental
                  influences). The structure of pedigrees, and the
                  types of loops occurring, is discussed. Some results
                  in graph theory are obtained and, using these, a
                  recurrence relation derived for certain
                  probabilities. The recursive procedure enables the
                  successive peeling off of certain members of the
                  pedigree, and the condensation of the information on
                  those individuals into a function on a subset of
                  those remaining. The underlying theory is set out,

  Abstract =	 {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an
                  important role in many robotic applications. A main
                  prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown
                  area is the capability of autonomously navigate,
                  exploiting the information acquired through the
                  on-line estimation of both robot poses and
                  surrounding environment model, according to
                  Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)
                  framework. As team coordination is improved,
                  distributed techniques for filtering are required in
                  order to enhance autonomous exploration and large
                  scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness
                  of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle
                  Filters (RBPF) have been demonstrated to be an
                  effective solution to the problem of single robot
                  SLAM, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and
                  these approaches are characterized by strict
                  assumptions on both communication bandwidth and
                  prior knowledge on relative poses of the
                  teammates. In the present paper we address the
                  problem of multi robot SLAM in the case of limited
                  communication and unknown relative initial
                  poses. Starting from the well established single
                  robot RBPF-SLAM, we propose a simple technique which
                  jointly estimates SLAM posterior of the robots by
                  fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive
                  information acquired by each teammate. The approach
                  intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be
                  exchanged among the robots, while taking into
                  account the uncertainty in relative pose
                  measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended
                  to different communication technologies (bluetooth,
                  RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing
                  range. The proposed approach is validated through
                  experimental test.},

@article{Cartwright87bc,
  Abstract =	 {Experiments by Fabre (1915), Thorpe (1950),
                  Chmurzynski (1964), and most recently Gould (1986)
                  suggest that insects have maps of their terrain
                  which enable them to find their way directly to a
                  goal when they are displaced several hundred metres
                  from it. This paper discusses what might constitute
                  an insect's map in terms of a two-part computational
                  model. The first part describes how an insect
                  reaches a goal when the insect is sufficiently close
                  that it can see some of the landmarks which are
                  visible from the goal. The second part considers the
                  problem of navigating when there is no similarity
                  between the view from the release-site and the view
                  from the goal. We start from a model designed to
                  explain how a bee might return to a goal using a
                  two-dimensional snapshot of the landscape seen from
                  the goal (Collett and Cartwright 1983). To guide its
                  return, the model bee continuously compares its
                  snapshot with its current retinal image and moves so
                  as to reduce the discrepancy between the two. Bees
                  can only be guided in the right direction by the
                  difference between current retinal image and
                  snapshot when there is some resemblance between the
                  two. In a realistically cluttered world, snapshot
                  and retinal image become very dissimilar only a
                  short distance from the goal. To increase the
                  distance from which a model bee can return, the bee
                  takes two snapshots at the goal. The first snapshot
                  excludes landmarks near to the goal and the second
                  snapshot includes them. With close landmarks
                  filtered from both snapshot and retinal image, the
                  match between the two deteriorates gradually as the
                  bee moves away from the goal. A model bee using a
                  filtered snapshot and image finds its way back to
                  the neighbourhood of the goal from a relatively long
                  distance (Fig. 2). The bee then switches to the
                  second snapshot and is guided to the precise spot by
                  its memory of the close landmarks. For longer range
                  guidance, the model bee is equipped with an album of
                  snapshots, each taken at a different location within
                  the terrain. Linked to each snapshot is a vector
                  encoding the distance and direction from the place
                  where the snapshot was taken to the hive. When the
                  bee is displaced to a new position, it selects the
                  snapshot which best matches its current image and
                  follows the associated home-vector back to the hive
                  (Fig. 3). Such a hive-centred map can also be used
                  to devise novel routes to places other than the
                  hive. For instance, a bee can reach a foraging site
                  from anywhere in its terrain by adding the
                  home-vector recalled at the starting position to a
                  vector specifying the distance and direction of the
                  foraging site from the hive. The sum of these two
                  vectors defines a direct trajectory to the foraging
                  site.},

                  problem. Our results show that in large environments
                  the map quickly becomes inconsistent due to
                  linearization errors. We propose a new EKF-based
                  SLAM algorithm, robocentric mapping, that greatly
                  reduces linearization errors, improving map
                  consistency. We also present results showing that
                  large-scale mapping methods based on building local
                  maps with a local uncertainty representation
                  (Tard�os et al., 2002) have better consistency than

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we study the Extended Kalman Filter
                  approach to the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (EKF-SLAM), describing its known properties
                  and limi- tations, and concentrate on the filter
                  consistency issue. We show that linearization of the
                  inherent nonlinearities of both the vehicle motion
                  and the sensor models fre- quently drives the
                  solution of the EKF-SLAM out of consistency,
                  specially in those situations where uncertainty
                  surpasses a certain threshold. We propose a mapping
                  algorithm, Robocentric Map Joining, which improves
                  consistency of the EKF-SLAM algorithm by limiting
                  the level of uncertainty in the continuous evolution
                  of the sto- chastic map: (1) by building a sequence
                  of independent local maps, and (2) by using a robot
                  centered representation of each local
                  map. Simulations and a large-scale in- door/outdoor
                  experiment validate the proposed approach.},

  Abstract =	 {A distributed multitarget tracking problem is
                  considered. The joint probabilistic data association
                  (JPDA) algorithm, which has been successfully used
                  for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered
                  environment, assumes a centralized processing
                  architecture. It assumes that measurements are
                  transmitted to a central site and processed. In some
                  applications, however, it may be desirable for the
                  sensor measurements to be processed at or near the
                  sensors instead of transmitting them to the central
                  processor. The local processed results are then sent
                  over a communication network to be used by other
                  processors. This paper presents a distributed
                  version of the JPDA algorithm which is applicable

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a hybrid approach to the
                  segmentation of range images into planar
                  regions. The term hybrid refers to a combination of
                  edge- and region-based considerations. A reliable
                  computational procedure which takes the range image
                  discontinuities into account is presented for
                  computing the pixel's normal. The segmentation
                  algorithm consists of two parts. In the first one,
                  the pixels are aggregated according to local
                  properties derived from the input data and are
                  represented by a region adjacency graph (RAG). At
                  this stage, the image is still over-segmented. In
                  the second part, the segmentation is refined thanks
                  to the construction of an irregular pyramid. The
                  base of the pyramid is the RAG previously
                  extracted. The over-segmented regions are merged
                  using a surface-based description. This algorithm
                  has been evaluated on 80 real images acquired by two
                  different range sensors using the methodology
                  proposed in (Hoover et al., 1996). Experimental
                  results are presented and compared to others
                  obtained by four research groups},

  Abstract =	 {We describe an algorithm for reconstructing
                  three-dimensional structure and motion causally, in
                  real time from monocular sequences of images. We
                  prove that the algorithm is minimal and stable, in
                  the sense that the estimation error remains bounded
                  with probability one throughout a sequence of
                  arbitrary length. We discuss a scheme for handling
                  occlusions (point features appearing and
                  disappearing) and drift in the scale factor. These
                  issues are crucial for the algorithm to operate in
                  real time on real scenes. We describe in detail the
                  implementation of the algorithm, which runs on a
                  personal computer and has been made available to the
                  community. We report the performance of our
                  implementation on a few representative long
                  sequences of real and synthetic images. The
                  algorithm, which has been tested extensively over
                  the course of the past few years, exhibits honest
                  performance when the scene contains at least 20-40
                  points with high contrast, when the relative motion
                  is "slow" compared to the sampling frequency of the
                  frame grabber (30 Hz), and the lens aperture is
                  "large enough" (typically more than 30� of visual

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a strategy for achieving
                  practical mapping navigation using a wheels driven
                  robot equipped with a sonarray (an advanced sonar
                  array). The original mapping navigation experiment,
                  carried out with the same robot configuration,
                  builds a feature map consisting of commonplace
                  indoor landmarks crucial for localisation, namely
                  planes, corners and edges. The map exhaustively
                  maintains covariance matrices among all features,
                  thus presents a time and memory impediment to
                  practical navigation in large environments. The new
                  local mapping strategy proposed here breaks down a
                  large environment into a topology of local regions,
                  only maintaining the covariance among features in
                  the same local region, and the covariance among
                  local maps. This notion of two hierarchy
                  representation drastically improves the memory and
                  processing time requirements of the original global
                  approach, while preserving the statistical details
                  necessary for an accurate map and prolonged
                  navigation. The new local mapping scheme also
                  extends the endeavour towards reducing error
                  accumulation made in the global mapping strategy by
                  eliminating totally error accumulated between visits
                  to the same part of an environment. This is achieved
                  with a map matching strategy developed exclusively
                  for the advanced sonar sensor employed. The local
                  mapping strategy has been tested in large, real life
                  indoor environments and successful results are
                  reported here.},

  Abstract =	 {One of the critical components of mapping an unknown
                  environment is the robot? ability to locate itself
                  on a partially explored map. This becomes
                  challenging when the robot experiences positioning
                  error, does not have an external positioning device,
                  nor the luxury of engineered landmarks placed in its
                  free space. This paper presents a new method for
                  simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits
                  the topology of the robot? free space to localize
                  the robot on a partially constructed map. The
                  topology of the environment is encoded in a
                  topological map; the particular topological map used
                  in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph
                  (GVG), which also encodes some metric information
                  about the robot? environment, as well. In this
                  paper, we present the low-level control laws that
                  generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby allowing
                  for exploration of an unknown space. With these
                  prescribed control laws, the GVG (or other
                  topological map) can be viewed as an arbitrator for
                  a hybrid control system that determines when to
                  invoke a particular low-level controller from a set
                  of controllers all working toward the high-level
                  capability of mobile robot exploration. The main
                  contribution, however, is using the graph structure
                  of the GVG, via a graph matching process, to
                  localize the robot. Experimental results verify the
                  described work.},

  Abstract =	 {A method is presented to approximate optimally an
                  $n$-dimensional discrete probability distribution by
                  a product of second-order distributions, or the
                  distribution of the first-order tree dependence. The
                  problem is to find an optimum set of $n-1$ first
                  order dependence relationship among the $n$
                  variables. It is shown that the procedure derived in

  Abstract =	 {An integrated representation of large-scale space,
                  or cognitive map, colled PLAN, is presented that
                  attempts to address a broader spectrum of issues
                  than has been previously attempted in a single
                  model. Rather than examining way-finding as a
                  process separate from the rest of cognition, one or
                  the fundamental goals of this work is to examine how
                  the wayfinding process is integrated into general
                  cognition. One result of this approach is that the
                  model is ?eads-up? or scene-based, because it takes
                  advantage of the properties of the human visual
                  system and, particularly, the visual system's split
                  into two pathways. The emphasis on the human
                  location or ?here?system is new to cognitive mapping
                  and is port of an attempt to synthesize prototype
                  theory, associative networks and location together
                  in a connectionist system. Not all of PLAN is new,
                  however. Many of its parts have analogues in one or
                  another preexisting theory. What makes PLAN unique
                  is integrating the various components into a
                  coherent whole, and the capacity of this resulting
                  system to speak to a wide range of constraints. Our
                  approach emphasizes adaptiveness; thus, our focus on
                  such issues as ease of use and efficiency of
                  learning. The result is a model that has a stronger
                  relationship both to the environment, and to the
                  ways that humans interact with it, compared with
                  previous models. The resulting model is examined in
                  some detail and compared to other systems.},

                  error framework to identify the hardness of the

                  limit (Bayes error rate) w.r.t. various factors are
                  indeed really interesting, and provides a lot of

                  and also clearly provides the direction for future
                  research direction. For example, the authors state
                  that the sequential data alone will not be enough
                  alone for learning since the Bayes error rate can
                  not be adjusted anyway, and provides insight that

                  that obscures some of the most important
                  computational strategies used by the
                  brain. .. 1. The Visual World. What we see at any
                  given moment is in general a fully elaborated
                  representation of a visual scene. .. 2. Hierarchical
                  Processing. Signal elaboration proceeds from the
                  various retinal stages, to the LGN, and thence to
                  higher and higher cortical processing
                  stages. .. 3. Dependency Relations. Higher levels in
                  the processing hierarchy depend on lower levels, but
                  not, in general, vice versa. .. Note finally that
                  the caricature, and, most especially, the "visual
                  world" assumption of the caricature, gets compelling
                  endorsement from common sense. .. We conjecture that
                  the undeniable feeling of having whole scene visual
                  representation is the result mainly of (1) repeated
                  visual visits to stimuli in the scene, (2)
                  short-term semantic memory on the order of a few
                  seconds that maintains the general sense of what is
                  going on without creating and maintaining the
                  point-by-point detail, (3) the brain's
                  "objectification" of sensory perception such that a
                  signal processed in cortex is represented as being
                  about an object in space. .. In any event, it may be
                  worth trying to rethink and reinterpret many
                  physiological and anatomical results under the
                  auspices of the idea that perception is driven by
                  the need to learn action sequences to be performed
                  in space and time.},
  R-Findlay04Cb ={Our understanding of these processes has progressed
                  to the point where vision is often described as a
                  flagship topic within neuroscience. Nevertheless,
                  the great majority of studies contributing to this
                  tradition involve a passive observer, thus
                  neglecting the continuous and sequential nature of
                  visual activity. The need for a different
                  perspective was given impetus by a recent
                  provocative paper, entitled ? Critique of Pure
                  Vision? written jointly by several eminent vision
                  scientists \cite{Churchland94chapter}. Active vision
                  is a name frequently used for the new approach, and

  Abstract =	 {This paper concerns the exploration of a natural
                  environment by a mobile robot equipped with both a
                  video color camera and a stereo-vision system. We
                  focus on the interest of such a multi-sensory system
                  to deal with the navigation of a robot in an a
                  priori unknown environment, including (1) the
                  incremental construction of a landmark-based model,
                  and the use of these landmarks for (2) the 3-D
                  localization of the mobile robot and for (3) a
                  sesnor-based navigation mode. For robot
                  localization, a slow process and a fast one are
                  simultaneously executed during the robot motions. In
                  the Modeling process (currently 0.1 Hz), the global
                  landmark-based model is incrementally built and the
                  robot situation can be estimated from discriminant
                  landmarks selected amongst the detected objects in
                  the range data. In the tracking process (currently 4
                  Hz), selected landmarks are tracked in the visual
                  data; the tracking results are used to simplify the
                  matching between landmarks in the modeling
                  process. Finally, a sensor-based visual navigation
                  mode, based on the same landmark selection and
                  tracking, is also presented; in order to navigate
                  during a long robot motion, different landmarks
                  (targets) can be selected as a sequence of sub-goals
                  that the robot must successively reach.},

                  uncalibrated images of architectural scenes. We
                  propose a simple, geometrically intuitive method
                  which exploits the strong rigidity constraints of
                  parallelism and orthogonality present in indoor and
                  outdoor architectural scenes. We show how these
                  simple constraints can be used to calibrate the
                  cameras and to recover the projection matrices for
                  each viewpoint. The projection matrices are used to
                  recover partial 3D models of the scene and these can
                  be used to visualise new viewpoints. Our approach
                  does not need any a priori information about the
                  cameras being used. A working system called
                  PhotoBuilder had been designed and implemented to
                  allow a user to interactively build a VRML model of
                  a building from uncalibrated images from arbitrary

  Abstract =	 {We present a new parametrization for point fea-
                  tures within monocular simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate
                  representation of un- certainty during undelayed
                  initialization and beyond, all within the standard
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept is
                  direct parametrization of the inverse depth of
                  features rela- tive to the camera locations from
                  which they were first viewed, which produces
                  measurement equations with a high degree of
                  linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features over a huge range of depths, even
                  those that are so far from the cam- era that they
                  present little parallax during motion---maintaining
                  sufficient representative uncertainty that these
                  points retain the op- portunity to ``come in''
                  smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger
                  movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in
                  the sense that even distant features are immediately
                  used to improve cam- era motion estimates, acting
                  initially as bearing references but not permanently
                  labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization
                  remains well behaved for features at all stages of
                  SLAM process- ing, but has the drawback in
                  computational terms that each point is represented
                  by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard
                  three of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show
                  that once the depth estimate of a feature is
                  sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely
                  be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose
                  a linearity index that allows automatic detection
                  and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency---only
                  low parallax features need be maintained in inverse
                  depth form for long periods. We present a real-time
                  implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization
                  is validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system
                  featuring a hand- held single camera with no
                  additional sensing. Experiments show robust
                  operation in challenging indoor and outdoor
                  environments with a very large ranges of scene

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a method for Simultaneous
                  Localization and Mapping (SLAM) relying on a
                  monocular camera as the only sensor, which is able
                  to build outdoor, closed-loop maps much larger than
                  previously achieved with such input. Our system,
                  based on the Hierarchical Map approach by Estrada et
                  al. (2005), builds independent local maps in
                  real-time using the EKF-SLAM technique and the
                  inverse depth representation proposed by Montiel et
                  al. (2006). The main novelty in the local mapping
                  process is the use of a data association technique
                  that greatly improves its robustness in dynamic and
                  complex environments. A new visual map matching
                  algorithm stitches these maps together and is able
                  to detect large loops automatically, taking into
                  account the unobservability of scale intrinsic to
                  pure monocular SLAM. The loop closing constraint is
                  applied at the upper level of the Hierarchical Map
                  in near real-time. We present experimental results
                  demonstrating monocular SLAM as a human carries a
                  camera over long walked trajectories in outdoor
                  areas with people and other clutter, even in the
                  more difficult case of forward-looking camera, and
                  show the closing of loops of several hundred
                  meters.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, an absolute localization paradigm
                  based on the cooperation of an omnidirectional
                  vision system composed of a conical mirror and a CCD
                  camera and a low cost panoramic range finder system
                  is reported. These two sensors, which have been used
                  independently until now, provide some complementary
                  data. This association enables us to build a robust
                  sensorial model which integrates an important number
                  of significant primitives. We can thus realize an
                  absolute localization of the mobile robot in
                  particular configurations, like symmetric
                  environments, where it is not possible to determine
                  the position with the use of only one of the two
                  sensors. In a first part, we present our global
                  perception system. In a second part, we describe our
                  sensorial model building approach. Finally we
                  present an absolute localization method which uses
                  three matching criteria fused thanks to the
                  combination rules of the Dempster-Shafer theory. The
                  basic probability assignment got for each primitive
                  matching enables to estimate the reliability of the
                  localization. We test our global absolute
                  localization system on several robots' elementary
                  moves in an indoor and symmetric environment},

                  from having to know how the data is organized in the
                  machine (the internal representation). A prompting
                  service which supplies such information is not a
                  satisfactory solution. Activities of users at
                  terminals and most application programs should
                  remain unaffected when the internal representation
                  of data is changed and even when some aspects of the
                  external representation are changed. Changes in data
                  representation will often be needed as a result of
                  changes in query, update, and report traffic and
                  natural growth in the types of stored

                  slightly more general network models of the data. In

                  than logical inference) are discussed and applied to

                  robots. The team consists of a navigator that has to

                  of cartographers that randomly move through the
                  environment to nd the target location. When a robot

                  communicated among the cartographers to the
                  navigation robot which then starts to move to that
                  location. In extensive experiments, the author

                  evolves slowly over time, while technical systems
                  are built to achieve an acceptable level of
                  confidence quite fast. Evidence for this could be
                  seen from a long term experiment described in
                  \citet{Golledge97book}. This study addressed the
                  metric knowledge of people, who had newly arrived in
                  an unknown city, and therefore were totally
                  unfamiliar with the new environment. In order to
                  monitor the gain of spatial knowledge the spatial
                  layout of the cognitive map has been reconstructed
                  using a multidimensional scaling (MDS)

                  observed over nine months, showed a steadily
                  increasing precision of metric knowledge. It has
                  further been shown that subjects tend to stick to
                  preferred routes, and that these routes are
                  represented more accurately than less experienced

  Abstract =	 {Video-surveillance and traffic analysis systems can
                  be heavily improved using vision-based techniques
                  able to extract, manage and track objects in the
                  scene. However, problems arise due to shadows. In
                  particular, moving shadows can affect the correct
                  localization, measurements and detection of moving
                  objects. This work aims to present a technique for
                  shadow detection and suppression used in a system
                  for moving visual object detection and tracking. The
                  major novelty of the shadow detection technique is
                  the analysis carried out in the HSV color space to
                  improve the accuracy in detecting shadows. Signal
                  processing and optic motivations of the approach
                  proposed are described. The integration and
                  exploitation of the shadow detection mod- ule into
                  the system are outlined and experimental results are
                  shown and evaluated.},

  Abstract =	 {Background subtraction methods are widely exploited
                  for moving object detection in videos in many
                  applications, such as traffic monitoring, human
                  motion capture, and video surveillance. How to
                  correctly and efficiently model and update the
                  background model and how to deal with shadows are
                  two of the most distinguishing and challenging
                  aspects of such approaches. This work proposes a
                  general-purpose method that combines statistical
                  assumptions with the object- level knowledge of
                  moving objects, apparent objects (ghosts), and
                  shadows acquired in the processing of the previous
                  frames. Pixels belonging to moving objects, ghosts,
                  and shadows are processed differently in order to
                  supply an object-based selective update. The
                  proposed approach exploits color information for
                  both background subtraction and shadow detection to
                  improve object segmentation and background
                  update. The approach proves fast, flexible, and

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the
                  problem of recognizing places based on their
                  appearance. The system we present is not limited to
                  localization, but can determine that a new
                  observation comes from a previously unseen place,
                  and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM
                  system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic
                  approach allows us to explicitly account for
                  perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical
                  but indistinctive observations receive a low
                  probability of having come from the same place. We
                  achieve this by learning a generative model of place
                  appearance. By partitioning the learning problem
                  into two parts, new place models can be learned
                  online from only a single observation of a
                  place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the
                  number of places in the map, and is particularly
                  suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile
                  robotics. 10.1177/0278364908090961},

  Abstract =	 {SLAM, the problem of a mobile robot building a map
                  of its environment while simultaneously having to
                  determine its location within that map, is one of
                  the current fundamental challenges of
                  robotics. Although a great deal of success has been
                  achieved with laser range finders as sensors and a
                  planar world assumption, low-cost commercial robots
                  will benefit from robust SLAM using cameras
                  only. Towards the goal of a robust, six
                  degree-of-freedom, vision-based SLAM algorithm, we
                  describe the application of "FastSLAM" [1] to the
                  problem of estimating a map from observations of 3D
                  line segments using a trinocular stereo camera
                  rig. By maintaining not only multiple hypotheses
                  about the robot's position in space, but also
                  maintaining multiple maps corresponding to those
                  possible position hypothesis, the algorithm has the
                  potential to overcome the systematic map errors
                  induced by incorrect correspondence estimation.},

  Abstract =	 {In the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
                  problem, a mobile robot must build a map of its

                  location within that map. We propose a new
                  algorithm, for visual SLAM (VSLAM), in which the
                  robot? only sensory information is video
                  imagery. Our approach combines stereo vision with a
                  popular sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, the
                  Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, to simultaneously

                  maintain a distinct stochastic map for each of those

  Abstract =	 {We introduce an any-space algorithm for exact
                  inference in Bayesian networks, called recursive
                  conditioning. On one extreme, recursive conditioning
                  takes O(n) space and O(nexp(wlogn)) time - where n
                  is the size of a Bayesian network and w is the width
                  of a given elimination order - therefore,
                  establishing a new complexity result for
                  linear-space inference in Bayesian networks. On the
                  other extreme, recursive conditioning takes
                  O(nexp(w)) space and O(nexp(w)) time, therefore,
                  matching the complexity of state-of-the-art
                  algorithms based on clustering and elimination. In
                  between linear and exponential space, recursive
                  conditioning can utilize memory at increments of
                  X-bytes, where X is the number of bytes needed to
                  store a floating point number in a cache. Moreover,
                  the algorithm is equipped with a formula for
                  computing its average running time under any amount
                  of space, hence, providing a valuable tool for
                  time-space tradeoffs in demanding
                  applications. Recursive conditioning is therefore
                  the first algorithm for exact inference in Bayesian
                  networks to offer a smooth tradeoff between time and
                  space, and to explicate a smooth, quantitative
                  relationship between these two important resources.},

                  persistent object detection in urban

                  thermal domain is used to identify the ini- tial
                  regions-of-interest. Color and intensity information

                  corresponding regions-of-interest in the visible
                  domain. Within each region, input and background
                  gradient information are combined to form a Contour
                  Saliency Map. The binary contour fragments, obtained
                  from corresponding Contour Saliency Maps, are then
                  combined. An A* path-constrained search along wa-

  Abstract =	 {This paper demonstrates an approach which exploits
                  an active camera as a projective pointing
                  mechanism. The optical centre of a static camera is
                  notionally substituted by the centre of rotation of
                  the active camera, as is the image plane by a
                  frontal plane, a plane perpendicular to the optical
                  axis of the active camera in its resting
                  direction. Algorithms devised for 3D motion and 3D
                  structure recovery using a single passive camera
                  become immediately applicable to the active camera
                  without need for reformulation. Furthermore, because
                  the active camera can access a panoramic field of
                  view, instabilities which may arise when the field
                  of view is small, or because the shared field of
                  view between successive views after movement is
                  small, are lessened. Two quite different
                  applications of the idea are presented. In the
                  first, the homography between a planar surface in
                  the scene and the frontal plane is recovered and
                  used to recover scene trajectories. In the second,
                  the essential matrix between points in two
                  frontal-plane "views" is recovered and used to
                  determine the motion of a mobile vehicle.},

                  (SLAM) for mobile robots has focused on the
                  simplified case in which a robot is considered to
                  move in two dimensions on a ground plane. While this
                  is often a good approximation, a large number of
                  real-world applications require robots to move
                  around terrain which has significant slopes and
                  undulations, and it is desirable that these robots
                  too should be able to estimate their locations by
                  building maps of natural features. In this paper we
                  describe a real-time EKF-based SLAM system
                  permitting unconstrained 3D localisation, and in

                  wheeled robot in the presence of unknown slope
                  variations. In a fully automatic implementation, our
                  robot observes visual point features using fixating
                  stereo vision and builds a sparse map
                  on-the-fly. Combining this visual measurement with
                  information from odometry and a roll/pitch
                  accelerometer sensor, the robot performs accurate,

                  performance is required rather than under the

                  achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from
                  measurements of a continuously expanding set of
                  selfmapped visual features is one of a class of
                  problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and

                  argue that such real-time mapping research, despite

                  and mapping (SLAM) - an algorithm which is
                  applicable to the localisation of any camera moving
                  through a scene - and study its application to the
                  localisation of a wearable robot with active
                  vision. Starting from very sparse initial scene
                  knowledge, a map of natural point features spanning
                  a section of a room is generated on-the-fly as the
                  motion of the camera is simultaneously estimated in
                  full 3D. Naturally this permits the annotation of
                  the scene with rigidly-registered graphics, but
                  further it permits automatic control of the robot?
                  active camera: for instance, fixation on a
                  particular object can be maintained during extended
                  periods of arbitrary user motion, then shifted at
                  will to another object which has potentially been
                  out of the field of view. This kind of functionality
                  is the key to the understanding or "management" of a
                  workspace which the robot needs to have in order to
                  assist its wearer usefully in tasks. We believe that

                  used in computer vision. The issue is one of feature
                  contact: each landmark object mapped remains visible
                  through a larger range of camera motion, meaning
                  that feature density can be reduced and camera
                  movement range can be increased. Further,
                  localisation stability is improved since features at

                  state of the world and therefore on the detailed
                  measurements which will be obtained. While such
                  priors are commonly combined with the actual
                  measurements via Bayes?rule to calculate posterior
                  probability distributions on model parameters, their
                  additional value in guiding efficient image
                  processing has almost always been overlooked. Priors
                  tell us where to look for information in an image,
                  how much computational effort we can expect to
                  expend to extract it, and of how much utility to the
                  task in hand it is likely to be. Such considerations
                  are of importance in all practical real-time vision
                  systems, where the processing resources available at
                  each frame in a sequence are strictly limited ?and

                  such as trackers where strong priors are most likely
                  to be available. In this paper, we use Shannon
                  information theory to analyse the fundamental value

  Abstract =	 {Recognition of objects or environmental landmarks is
                  problematic because appearance can vary widely
                  depending on illumination, viewing distance, angle
                  of view and so on. Storing a separate image or
                  `template' for every possible view requires vast
                  numbers to be stored and scanned, has a high
                  probability of recognition error and appears not to
                  be the solution adopted by primates. However, some
                  invertebrate template matching systems can achieve
                  recognition by `active vision' in which the animal's
                  own behaviour is used to achieve a fit between
                  template and object, for example by repeatedly
                  following a set path. Recognition is thus limited to
                  views from the set path but achieved with a minimal
                  number of templates. Here we report the first
                  evidence of similar active vision in a bird, in the
                  form of locomotion and individually distinct head
                  movements that give the eyes a similar series of

  Abstract =	 {This article presents a class of approximation
                  algorithms that extend the idea of
                  bounded-complexity inference, inspired by successful
                  constraint propagation algorithms, to probabilistic
                  inference and combinatorial optimization. The idea
                  is to bound the dimensionality of dependencies
                  created by inference algorithms. This yields a
                  parameterized scheme, called mini-buckets, that
                  offers adjustable trade-off between accuracy and
                  efficiency. The mini-bucket approach to optimization
                  problems, such as finding the most probable
                  explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks, generates
                  both an approximate solution and bounds on the
                  solution quality. We present empirical results
                  demonstrating successful performance of the proposed
                  approximation scheme for the MPE task, both on
                  randomly generated problems and on realistic domains

  Abstract =	 {The paper introduces an AND/OR search space
                  perspective for graphical models that include
                  probabilistic networks (directed or undirected) and
                  constraint networks. In contrast to the traditional
                  (OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree
                  displays some of the independencies present in the
                  graphical model explicitly and may sometimes reduce
                  the search space exponentially. Indeed, most
                  algorithmic advances in search-based constraint
                  processing and probabilistic inference can be viewed
                  as searching an AND/OR search tree or
                  graph. Familiar parameters such as the depth of a
                  spanning tree, treewidth and pathwidth are shown to
                  play a key role in characterizing the effect of
                  AND/OR search graphs vs. the traditional OR search
                  graphs. We compare memory intensive AND/OR graph
                  search with inference methods, and place various
                  existing algorithms within the AND/OR search
                  space. },

  Abstract =	 {Bucket elimination is an algorithmic framework that
                  generalizes dynamic programming to accommodate many
                  problem-solving and reasoning tasks. Algorithms such
                  as directional-resolution for propositional
                  satisfiability, adaptive-consistency for constraint
                  satisfaction, Fourier and Gaussian elimination for
                  solving linear equalities and inequalities, and
                  dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization,
                  can all be accommodated within the bucket
                  elimination framework. Many probabilistic in-
                  ference tasks can likewise be expressed as
                  bucket-elimination algorithms. These include: belief
                  updating, finding the most probable explanation, and
                  expected utility maximization. These algorithms
                  share the same performance guarantees; all are time
                  and space exponential in the induced-width of the
                  problem's interaction graph. While elimination
                  strategies have extensive demands on memory, a
                  contrasting class of algorithms called "conditioning
                  search" require only linear space. Algorithms in
                  this class split a problem into subproblems by
                  instantiating a subset of variables, called a
                  conditioning set, or a cutset. Typical examples of
                  conditioning search algorithms are: backtracking (in
                  constraint satisfaction), and branch and bound (for
                  combinatorial optimization). The paper presents the
                  bucket-elimination framework as a unifying theme
                  across probabilistic and deterministic reasoning
                  tasks and show how conditioning search can be
                  augmented to systematically trade space for time.},

  Abstract =	 {QR factorization is most often used as a black box
                  algorithm, but is in fact an elegant computation on
                  a factor graph. By computing a rooted clique tree on
                  this graph, the computation can be parallelized
                  across subtrees, which forms the basis of so-called
                  multifrontal QR methods. By judiciously choosing the
                  order in which variables are eliminated in the
                  clique tree computation, we show that one
                  straightforwardly obtains a method for performing
                  inference in distributed sensor networks. One
                  obvious application is distributed localization and
                  mapping with a team of robots. We phrase the problem
                  as inference on a large-scale Gaussian Markov Random
                  Field induced by the measurement factor graph, and
                  show how multifrontal QR on this graph solves for
                  the global map and all the robot poses in a
                  distributed fashion. The method is illustrated using

  Abstract =	 {Solving the SLAM problem is one way to enable a
                  robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously
                  unknown environment. We investigate smoothing
                  approaches as a viable alternative to extended
                  Kalman filter-based solutions to the problem. In
                  particular, we look at approaches that factorize
                  either the associated information matrix or the
                  measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such
                  techniques have several significant advantages over
                  the EKF: they are faster yet exact, they can be used
                  in either batch or incremental mode, are better
                  equipped to deal with non-linear process and
                  measurement models, and yield the entire robot
                  trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of SLAM
                  problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic
                  way, column ordering heuristics automatically
                  exploit the locality inherent in the geographic
                  nature of the SLAM problem. In this paper we present
                  the theory underlying these methods, along with an
                  interpretation of factorization in terms of the
                  graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. We
                  present both simulation results and actual SLAM
                  experiments in large-scale environments that
                  underscore the potential of these methods as an
                  alternative to EKF-based approaches.},

                  accuracy and realism of coarse piecewise planar
                  models from an uncalibrated sequence of
                  images. First, dense depth maps are estimated by
                  aligning a planar region of a scene in each image,
                  approximating camera calibration, and generating
                  dense planar parallax. These depth maps are then
                  robustly fused to obtain incrementally refined
                  surface estimates. It is envisaged that this system
                  will extend the modelling capability of existing
                  systems [Cipolla99icmcs] which generate simple,

  Abstract =	 {The idea of synthesizing bounded length plans by
                  compiling planning problems into a combinatorial
                  substrate, and solving the resulting encodings has
                  become quite popular in recent years. Most work
                  to-date has however concentrated on compilation to
                  satisfiability (SAT) theories and integer linear
                  programming (ILP). In this paper we will show that
                  CSP is a better substrate for the compilation
                  approach, compared to both SAT and ILP. We describe
                  GP-CSP, a system that does planning by automatically
                  converting Graphplan's planning graph into a CSP
                  encoding and solving it using standard CSP
                  solvers. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation of
                  GP-CSP demonstrates that it is superior to both the
                  Blackbox system, which compiles planning graphs into
                  SAT encodings, and an ILP-based planner in a wide
                  range of planning domains. Our results show that CSP
                  encodings outperform SAT encodings in terms of both
                  space and time requirements in various problems. The
                  space reduction is particularly important as it
                  makes GP-CSP less susceptible to the memory blow-up
                  associated with SAT compilation methods. The paper
                  also discusses various techniques in setting up the
                  CSP encodings, planning specific improvements to CSP
                  solvers, and strategies for variable and value
                  selection heuristics for solving the CSP encodings
                  of different types of planning problems.},

  Comment =	 {What is the trade-off bewteen the state (memory ) of
                  the agent and the amount of information
                  communicated? - quite theoretical analysis - using
                  complexity theory + some nice examples, i.e. why it
                  is easier to search a maze then a graph? or if a
                  robot has a compas how much more powerfull it
                  becomes, or - the types of invariants discussed here
                  are task related - (not sensor related). Until know
                  most widely used invariat in kinodynamics was time,
                  i.e most of the cost functions were expressed in
                  terms of time. The conclusions are that
                  communication between agents while searching a maze
                  is equivalent to a single agent with pebbles
                  seraching the maze, i.e. side-effecting the
                  environment has the same complexity as
                  communication. Also if an automaton has an counter
                  there exist a log-space algorithm to search the maze
                  vs. linear time algorithms.},

  Abstract =	 {The undirected technique for evaluating belief
                  networks [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and
                  Spiegelhalter, 1988] requires clustering the nodes
                  in the network into a junction tree. In the
                  traditional view, the junction tree is constructed
                  from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated
                  belief network: triangulation is taken to be the
                  primitive concept, the goal towards which any
                  clustering algorithm (e.g. node elimination) is
                  directed. In this paper, we present an alternative
                  conception of clustering, in which clusters and the
                  junction tree property play the role of primitives:
                  given a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a
                  modified version of) the junction tree property, we
                  transform this graph until we have obtained a
                  tree. There are several advantages to this approach:
                  it is much clearer and easier to understand, which
                  is important for humans who are constructing belief
                  networks; it admits a wider range of heuristics
                  which may enable more efficient or superior
                  clustering algorithms; and it serves as the natural
                  basis for an incremental clustering scheme, which we
                  describe.},

  Abstract =	 {An overview of some fuzzy set-based approaches to
                  scheduling is proposed, emphasizing two distinct
                  uses of fuzzy sets: representing preference profiles
                  and modelling uncertainty distributions. The first
                  setting leads to a valued, noncompensatory
                  generalization of constraint-directed
                  scheduling. The other setting yields a
                  possibility-theoretic counterpart of PERT, where
                  probability distributions of activity durations are
                  changed into possibility distributions, for the
                  purpose of modelling incomplete information. It is
                  pointed out that a special case of the latter,
                  interval-valued PERT, is a difficult, ill-known
                  problem, regarding the determination of critical
                  activities, latest starting times and floats. Lastly
                  when flexible constraints and uncertain processing
                  times are to be jointly considered, the use of
                  possibilistic decision theory leads to the
                  computation of robust schedules. },

  Abstract =	 {Mobile robots require the ability to build their own
                  maps to operate in unknown environments. A
                  fundamental problem is that odometry-based dead
                  reckoning cannot be used to assign accurate global
                  position information to a map because of drift
                  errors caused by wheel slippage. This paper
                  introduces a fast, on-line method of learning
                  globally consistent maps, using only local metric
                  information. The approach differs from previous work
                  in that it is computationally cheap, easy to
                  implement and is guaranteed to find a globally
                  optimal solution. Experiments are presented in which
                  large, complex environments were successfully mapped
                  by a real robot, and quantitative performance
                  measures are used to assess the quality of the maps
                  obtained.},

  Abstract =	 {Addressed is the problem of robotic exploration of a
                  graphlike world, where no distance or orientation
                  metric is assumed of the world. The robot is assumed
                  to be able to autonomously traverse graph edges,
                  recognize when it has reached a vertex, and
                  enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex
                  relative to the edge via which it entered the
                  current vertex. The robot cannot measure distances,
                  and it does not have a compass. It is demonstrated
                  that this exploration problem is unsolvable in
                  general without markers, and, to solve it, the robot
                  is equipped with one or more distinct markers that
                  can be put down or picked up at will and that can be
                  recognized by the robot if they are at the same
                  vertex as the robot. An exploration algorithm is
                  developed and proven correct. Its performance is
                  shown on several example worlds, and heuristics for
                  improving its performance are discussed.},

  Abstract =	 {Neurons in the dorsal region of the medial superior
                  temporal area (MSTd) have previously been shown to
                  respond to the expanding radial motion that occurs
                  as an observer moves through the environment. In
                  previous experiments, MSTd neurons were tested with
                  radial and circular motion centered in the visual
                  field. However, different directions of observer
                  motion, relative to the direction of gaze, are
                  accompanied by visual motion centered at different
                  locations in the visual field. The present
                  experiments investigated whether neurons that
                  respond to radial and circular motion might respond
                  differently when the center of motion was shifted to
                  different regions of the visual field. About 90\% of
                  the 245 neurons studied responded differently when
                  the center of motion was shifted away from the
                  center of the field. The centers of motion preferred
                  by each neuron were limited to one area of the
                  visual field. All parts of the visual field were
                  represented in the sample, with greater numbers of
                  neurons preferring centers of motion closer to the
                  center of the field. We hypothesize that each of the
                  MSTd neurons has a center of motion field with a
                  gradient of preferred centers of motion, and that
                  there is an orderly arrangement of MSTd neurons with
                  each region of the visual field being represented by
                  a set of neurons. This arrangement creates the
                  potential for graded responses from individual
                  neurons for different directions of heading as an
                  observer moves through the environment.},

                  year, and still on-going, research program in
                  decentralised sensing systems. This program covers
                  both the theoretical development of data fusion
                  methods appropriate to networks of decentralised
                  sensors and the practical implementation of these in
                  both civilian and military contexts. The methods
                  employed for studying the decentralized data fusion
                  problem are based on the information-filter
                  formulation of the Kalman filter algorithm and on
                  information-theoretic methods derived from Bayes
                  theorem. This theory is briefly described in context
                  of a number of practical implementations of
                  decentralised data fusion methods in surveillance
                  and control applications. The paper describes
                  specific theoretical tools developed to address such
                  issues as; decentralised communication management,
                  model distribution, decentralised data association
                  and fault detection, sensor control (information

                  picture compilation and map building. Finally, we

                  Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) and the
                  extensive research on SLAM that has been undertaken
                  over the past decade. SLAM is the process by which a
                  mobile robot can build a map of an environment and
                  at the same time use this map to compute it's own

                  exciting progress in solving the SLAM problem
                  together with many compelling implementations of
                  SLAM methods. Part I of this tutorial (this paper),

                  problem, essential solution methods and significant

                  data fusion problems. This architecture takes the
                  form of a network of sensor nodes, each with its own
                  processing facility, which together do not require
                  any central processor or any central communication
                  facility. In this architecture, computation is
                  performed locally and communication occurs between
                  any two nodes. Such an architecture has many
                  desirable properties, including robustness to
                  sensors failure and flexibility to the addition or
                  loss of one or more sensors. This architecture is
                  appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter
                  (EKF)-based geometric data fusion problems. The
                  starting point for this architecture is an algorithm
                  which allows the complete decentralization of the
                  multisensor EKF equations among a number of sensing

  Abstract =	 {Localization and mapping in unknown environments
                  becomes more difficult as the complexity of the
                  environment increases. With conventional techniques,
                  the cost of maintaining estimates rises rapidly with
                  the number of landmarks mapped. We present a
                  monocular SLAM system that employs a particle filter
                  and top-down search to allow realtime performance
                  while mapping large numbers of landmarks. To our
                  knowledge, we are the first to apply this
                  FastSLAM-type particle filter to single-camera
                  SLAM. We also introduce a novel partial
                  initialization procedure that efficiently determines
                  the depth of new landmarks. Moreover, we use
                  information available in observations of new
                  landmarks to improve camera pose estimates. Results
                  show the system operating in real-time on a standard
                  workstation while mapping hundreds of landmarks.},

  Abstract =	 {Experiments are reported that assessed the ability
                  of people, without vision, to locate the positions
                  of objects from imagined points of observation that
                  are related to their actual position by rotational
                  or translational components. Theoretical issues
                  addressed were whether spatial relations stored in
                  an object-to-object system are directly retrieved or
                  whether retrieval is mediated by a bodycentered
                  coordinate system, and whether body-centered access
                  involves a process of imaging updating of
                  self-position. The results, with those of Rieser
                  (1989), indicate that in the case of regularly
                  structured object arrays, interobject relations are
                  directly retrieved for the translation task, but for
                  the rotation task, retrieval occurs by means of a
                  body-centered coordinate system, requiring imagined
                  body rotation. For irregularly structured arrays,
                  access of interobject spatial structure occurs by
                  means of a body-centered coordinate system for both
                  translation and rotation tasks, requiring imagined
                  body translation or rotation. Array regularity
                  affected retrieval of spatial structure in terms of

                  very good at "seeing as": for instance, should it
                  have had sufficient experience in outer space
                  travel, it may be capable of seeing the street scene
                  as a reenactment of a series of collisions among
                  rock and ice fragments in a particular cubic
                  kilometer of the Oort cloud on January 1, 0800 hours
                  UTC, 2008 CE, which it happened to have viewed while
                  on a heliopause cruise. .. Note that although the
                  evolution of visual systems may well be driven by
                  their role in supporting action and by their being
                  embodied in active, purposive agents (Noe, 2004),
                  once the system is in place no action is required
                  for it to "just see" (Edelman, 2006). .. [A key
                  realization is that] rather than conceptual,
                  purposive, and interpretation-driven, visual
                  experience, whether rich or impoverished, is
                  representational. As Wittgenstein (1958) noted, "To
                  interpret is to think, to do something; seeing is a
                  state." .. Both the feasibility of and the need for
                  an explicit and sweeping reconstruction of the
                  geometry of the visual world have been subsequently
                  questioned (Aloimonos et al., 1988; Bajcsy,
                  1988). Noting that biological vision is purposive
                  and active, researchers proposed that computer
                  vision too should aim at serving certain
                  well-defined goals such as navigation or recognition
                  rather than at constructing a general-purpose
                  representation of the world. .. From the
                  computational standpoint, this development amounted
                  to shifting the focus of research from "inverse
                  optics" approaches (Bertero et al., 1988), which aim
                  to recover the solid geometry of the viewed scene,
                  to managing feature-based evidence for task-specific
                  hypotheses about the input (Edelman and Poggio,
                  1989). .. Anticipating the idea of O'Regan (1992)
                  and O'Regan and Noe (2001) who argued that the world
                  is its own best representation, Reitman et
                  al. (1978, p.72) observed that "The primary function
                  of perception is to keep our internal framework in
                  good registration with that vast external memory,
                  the external environment itself."},

  Abstract =	 {This paper examines four current theoretical
                  approaches to the representation and recognition of
                  visual objects: structural descriptions, geometric
                  constraints, multidimensional feature spaces, and
                  shape-space approximation. The strengths and the
                  weaknesses of the theories are considered, with a
                  special focus on their approach to categorization ?
                  a computationally challenging task which is not
                  widely addressed in computer vision (where the

                  recognition across changes of viewpoint).},

                  Neuroscience, UMIST, Manchester, UK \\ As we move
                  about the world and view objects from different
                  distances and directions, the images projected onto
                  the retina are correspondingly transformed?y
                  translation, magnification, rotation and so on. How,
                  despite rarely experiencing the same image twice, do
                  we recognize an object as being the same? This
                  problem has had a long and varied history involving
                  disparate disciplines: philosophy and psychology;
                  computer science, mathematics, and engineering;
                  anatomy and physiology; and, to a limited extent,
                  neurology. There is still no universally accepted
                  solution. In broad terms, explanatory theories can
                  be divided into two kinds: those that concentrate on
                  the nature of the internal model or representation
                  that the visual system forms of an object in the
                  external world, and those that concentrate on how
                  that representation alters with changes in the pose
                  of the object or changes in observer viewpoint. The
                  two approaches involve a trade-off. Thus, if the
                  representation is assumed to alter with a change in
                  viewpoint, then the visual system needs to apply an
                  internal restoring, interpolating, or normalizing
                  transformation for recognition to occur; and the
                  more work that is done in forming the representation
                  (the more invariant it is to viewpoint changes), the
                  less work that needs to be done in normalizing
                  it. In practice, factors such as the need to retain
                  information about viewpoint changes and whether
                  objects are to be compared simultaneously or
                  sequentially influence the extent of the
                  trade-off. \\ One of the first significant
                  theoretical analyses of visual (and auditory)
                  representation and recognition was undertaken in the
                  1940s by Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who
                  showed how a biological system could calculate
                  constant properties?nvariants?f entire images under
                  changes in viewpoint. It was not at all clear,
                  however, whether these global invariants could, or
                  should, be computed; moreover, the required
                  biological machinery seemed demanding, and the
                  representations assumed to be produced took little
                  account of the structure of the images presented to
                  the organism. \\ In the decades that followed, a
                  more object-centred approach to the problem of
                  extracting invariants developed. The idea was to
                  associate with each image a `structural
                  description', specifying the configuration of an
                  object's components or local features (e.g. lines
                  and edges) in terms of discrete or qualitative
                  relations between those features (e.g. `joined to',
                  `above', `left of'). Such a description was
                  naturally invariant to translations and
                  magnifications of the image on the retina, and,
                  depending on the choice of relations, to its
                  rotations. \\ A particular structural-description
                  theory of recognition, called
                  `recognition-by-components', has been advocated by
                  Irving Biederman. Here, the object components are
                  generalized cones, derived from contrasts of five
                  edge cues in a two-dimensional image: curvature,
                  collinearity, symmetry, parallelism and
                  co-termination. Visual detection of these elementary
                  properties is assumed to be invariant over viewing
                  position. Experiments on picture priming, where
                  speed and accuracy of recognition of a briefly
                  presented picture is facilitated by prior
                  presentation, suggested that priming depends on
                  activation of these components. Changes in position,
                  size, orientation-in-depth, or the particular lines
                  and vertices present in the image did not affect the
                  magnitude of the priming, as long as the same
                  generalized-cone components were assumed to be
                  activated. \\ Descriptions of the structure of
                  images based on object parts are appealing because
                  objects are often only part-seen, for example, from
                  the front only, or occluded by other objects. Such
                  descriptions naturally represent non-rigid or
                  articulated objects, for example, a body or hand;
                  and, phenomenologically, they accommodate our
                  experience that objects, such as a cup or a face,
                  are actually perceived as comprising
                  parts. Nevertheless, there has been some debate in
                  the literature about how well object parts can be
                  extracted from images and how well such descriptions
                  account for data on the recognition of novel and
                  familiar objects that have been rotated in depth. \\
                  An alternative to describing the structure of images
                  in terms of combinations of generic primitive shapes
                  is to describe them in terms of memory records of
                  similar images. One starting point for this theory
                  is that it is unreasonable for a visual system to
                  treat all possible shapes within the same parametric
                  framework: whereas similar shapes may need to be
                  compared in detail, very different shapes need
                  merely to be distinguished from each other. How,
                  then, should similar images be described? For a
                  given class of similar shapes, it is known from
                  statistical pattern-recognition theory that a
                  representation can be obtained in a common space
                  spanned by a small set of reference shapes,
                  generally referred to as basis functions. One way of
                  generating basis functions is to apply the
                  statistical technique of principal-components
                  analysis, which has been used successfully to
                  explain how the visual system approximates a
                  solution to the theoretically simpler problem of
                  surface colour constancy, that is, the constant
                  colour appearance of an object's surface independent
                  of the illuminant on the scene. Another way of
                  generating basis functions from a set of data is to
                  expose an artificial neural network to prototypical
                  examples drawn from that set. \\ In Representation
                  and Recognition in Vision, Shimon Edelman sets out
                  the case for such a network-based scheme called
                  Chorus. In this scheme, vectors of proximities to a
                  small number of prototypes are used to span the
                  representation space. The prototypes are derived
                  from recurring stable patterns of primitive
                  features, which, by definition, correspond to
                  frequently observed objects. Each prototype is
                  represented by an interpolation mechanism similar to
                  a basis-function neural network tuned to several of
                  the object's views, and is learned from examples. \\
                  The elementary building block of Chorus? unit tuned
                  to a specific view of a specific object?s inherently
                  viewpoint-dependent, but, because the tuning of the
                  individual units is wide (that is, they also
                  respond, usually less well, to views that differ
                  from the optimal), it is possible for a collection
                  of such units to interpolate the entire space of
                  views for a given object. Viewpoint invariance
                  achieved in this way will be approximate and
                  specific for the given object and the degree of
                  viewpoint invariance will decrease when the objects
                  to be discriminated are similar to each other. A
                  system of several object-specific modules of this
                  kind should exhibit some viewpoint invariance for
                  novel objects, by interpolating between the view
                  spaces of the familiar ones. \\ Support for Chorus
                  has come from experiments with synthesized images of
                  abstract, paperclip-like objects and more natural
                  animal-like objects. In one experiment, human
                  subjects were trained to discriminate between
                  computer images selected from classes of monkey-like
                  and dog-like objects. After subjects reached 90\%
                  correct on a fixed canonical view of each object,
                  discrimination performance was tested for novel
                  views that differed by up to 60?from the training
                  view. Despite differing only parametrically, that
                  is, in degree rather than in kind, these objects
                  were recognized virtually independently of
                  viewpoint, providing that the two classes were
                  sufficiently dissimilar. These and the results of
                  other experimental tests were taken as evidence for
                  a theory of recognition by views and against a
                  theory of recognition by components. \\ Which of
                  these two theories is the more appropriate
                  description of human object recognition is unlikely
                  to be resolved by appeals to neurobiology. For
                  example, recordings in macaque temporal cortex have
                  shown specificity for face view and gaze direction,
                  and the extent of any invariance to viewing
                  conditions is limited to about ?0?rotation in
                  depth. These results are certainly consistent with
                  Chorus, but, as Edelman points out, it is possible
                  that the function of the underlying units could be
                  irrelevant to the process of object recognition. \\
                  Views-based theories suffer from certain
                  foundational problems, as Edelman readily
                  acknowledges. Thus, a principled way needs to be
                  found for defining the set of objects constituting
                  the training set and for dealing with occlusion and
                  interference between the images of neighbouring
                  objects in a scene. There are also some outstanding
                  experimental issues; for example, how to account for
                  psychophysical data showing that shape recognition
                  and discrimination vary systematically with the
                  position of the image on the retina. More
                  critically, there is persistent evidence that small
                  changes in object shape can influence visual
                  perception in a way that seems more naturally
                  explained by components-based theory than by
                  views-based theory. \\ In Representation and
                  Recognition in Vision, Edelman argues strongly for a
                  particular approach to modelling human object
                  recognition, focusing arguments and evidence to that
                  end. It is a stimulating and informative book, but
                  better suited to the sophisticated reader, and
                  rather less so to the beginner hoping to achieve a
                  broad understanding of a sometimes contentious
                  field.},

  Abstract =	 {A common need in machine vision is to compute the
                  3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets
                  of points for which correspondence is known. A
                  comparative analysis is presented here of four
                  popular and efficient algorithms, each of which
                  computes the translational and rotational components
                  of the transform in closed form, as the solution to
                  a least squares formulation of the problem. They
                  differ in terms of the transformation representation
                  used and the mathematical derivation of the
                  solution, using respectively singular value
                  decomposition or eigensystem computation based on
                  the standard representation, and the eigensystem
                  analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual
                  quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison
                  presents both qualitative and quantitative results
                  of several experiments designed to determine (1) the
                  accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the
                  presence of different levels of noise, (2) the
                  stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and
                  (3) relative computation time of each approach under
                  different conditions. The results indicate that
                  under �ideal� data conditions (no noise) certain
                  distinctions in accuracy and stability can be
                  seen. But for �typical, real-world� noise levels,
                  there is no difference in the robustness of the
                  final solutions (contrary to certain previously
                  published results). Efficiency, in terms of
                  execution time, is found to be highly dependent on
                  the computer system setup.},

  Abstract =	 {Background subtraction is a method typically used to
                  seg- ment moving regions in image sequences taken
                  from a static camera by comparing each new frame to
                  a model of the scene background. We present a novel
                  non-parametric background model and a background
                  subtraction approach. The model can handle
                  situations where the back- ground of the scene is
                  cluttered and not completely static but contains
                  small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The
                  model estimates the probability of observing pixel
                  intensity values based on a sample of intensity
                  values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to
                  changes in the scene which enables very sensitive
                  detection of moving targets. We also show how the
                  model can use color information to suppress detec-
                  tion of shadows. The implementation of the model
                  runs in real-time for both gray level and color
                  imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach
                  achieves very sensitive detection with very low
                  false alarm rates.},

  Abstract =	 {Probabilistic approaches have proved very successful
                  at addressing the basic problems of robot
                  localization and mapping and they have shown great
                  promise on the combined problem of simultaneous
                  localization and mapping (SLAM). One approach to
                  SLAM assumes relatively sparse, relatively
                  unambiguous landmarks and builds a Kalman filter
                  over landmark positions. Other approaches assume
                  dense sensor data which individually are not very
                  distinctive, such as those available from a laser
                  range finder. In earlier work, we presented an
                  algorithm called DP-SLAM, which provided a very
                  accurate solution to the latter case by efficiently
                  maintaining a joint distribution over robot maps and
                  poses. The approach assumed an extremely accurate
                  laser range finder and a deterministic
                  environment. In this work we demonstrate an improved
                  map representation and laser penetration model, an
                  improvement in the asymptotic efficiency of the
                  algorithm, and empirical results of loop closing on
                  a high resolution map of a very challenging domain.},

                  mobile robots equipped only with stereo vision. Our
                  goal is to construct dense metric maps of natural 3D
                  point landmarks for large cyclic environments in the
                  absence of accurate landmark position measurements
                  and motion estimates. Our work differs from other
                  approaches because landmark estimates are derived
                  from stereo vision and motion estimates are based on
                  sparse optical flow. We distinguish between
                  landmarks using the Scale Invariant Feature
                  Transform (SIFT). This is in contrast to current
                  popular approaches that rely on reliable motion

                  landmark measurements obtained with laser

                  filter whose main component is the proposal
                  distribution, we develop and evaluate a novel
                  mixture proposal distribution that allows us to
                  robustly close large loops. We validate our approach

                  visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem
                  (SLAM). We focus on robots equipped with stereo
                  vision and develop a SLAM solution based on the
                  theory of the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter
                  (RBPF). We refer to our method as $\sigma$SLAM. We
                  construct maps of 3D point-landmarks identified by
                  their visual appearance. Specifically, we use the
                  Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for
                  distinguishing among the thousands of landmarks
                  present in the robot? environment. Our particle
                  filter approach utilizes a mixture proposal
                  distribution and accurately tracks the position of
                  the robot and the landmarks over long
                  trajectories. In addition, we do not depend on robot
                  odometry in the particle filter? proposal mechanism;
                  instead, we develop a proposal distribution that
                  relies on visual odometry easing the transition
                  towards a SLAM solution for robots performing 3D
                  motion. Most importantly, $\sigma$SLAM works in near
                  real-time making it applicable for use with mobile
                  robots today. Moreover, we show that we can

                  these are useful for path planning and obstacle
                  avoidance. Finally, we validate our approach

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we investigate the status of bundle
                  adjustment as a component of a real-time camera
                  tracking system and show that with current computing
                  hardware a significant amount of bundle adjustment
                  can be performed every time a new frame is added,
                  even under stringent real-time constraints. We also
                  show, by quantifying the failure rate over long
                  video sequences, that the bundle adjustment is able
                  to significantly decrease the rate of gross failures
                  in the camera tracking. Thus, bundle adjustment does
                  not only bring accuracy improvements. The accuracy
                  improvements also suppress error buildup in a way
                  that is crucial for the performance of the camera
                  tracker. Our experimental study is performed in the
                  setting of tracking the trajectory a calibrated
                  camera moving in 3D for various types of motion,
                  showing that bundle adjustment should be considered
                  an important component for a state-of-the-art

                  method that allows us to obtain accurate metric maps
                  of large environments in real time. The lower (or
                  local) map level is composed of a set of local maps
                  that are guaranteed to be statistically
                  independent. The upper (or global) level is an
                  adjacency graph whose arcs are labeled with the
                  relative location between local maps. An estimation
                  of these relative locations is maintained at this
                  level in a relative stochastic map. We propose a
                  close to optimal loop closing method that, while
                  maintaining independence at the local level, imposes
                  consistency at the global level at a computational
                  cost that is linear with the size of the
                  loop. Experimental results demonstrate the
                  efficiency and precision of the proposed method by
                  mapping the Ada Byron building at our campus. We
                  also analyze, using simulations, the precision and
                  convergence of our method for larger loops.},

                  the covariance of the other local maps when adding
                  an observation for a particular local map is that,
                  The reference of the local map is the location of
                  first robot pose with complete confidence(zero

                  Williams02icra. But what makes this paper is
                  different is using the loop closing for improving
                  the relative location of local maps with respect to
                  each other in the global map. They don't use this
                  data to update the local maps, because if so they
                  would have become dependent to each other. The good
                  thing about using the local maps is that since the

  Abstract =	 {Recently, there have been a number of variant
                  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
                  algorithms which have made substantial progress
                  towards large-area scalability by parameterizing the
                  SLAM posterior within the information
                  (canonical/inverse covariance) form. Of these,
                  probably the most well-known and popular approach is
                  the Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF) by
                  Thrun et al. While SEIFs have been successfully
                  implemented with a variety of challenging real-world
                  data sets and have lead to new insights into
                  scalable SLAM, open research questions remain
                  regarding the approximate sparsification procedure
                  and its effect on map error and consistency. In this
                  paper, we examine the constant-time SEIF
                  sparsification procedure in depth and offer new
                  insight into issues of consistency. In particular,
                  we show that exaggerated map inconsistency occurs
                  within the global reference frame where estimation
                  is performed, but that empirical testing shows that
                  relative local map relationships are preserved. We
                  then present a slightly modified version of their
                  sparsification procedure which is shown to preserve
                  sparsity while also generating both local and global
                  map estimates comparable to those obtained by the
                  non-sparsified SLAM filter; this modified
                  approximation, however, is no longer
                  constant-time. We demonstrate our findings by
                  benchmark comparison of the modified and original
                  SEIF sparsification rule using simulation in the
                  linear Gaussian SLAM case and real-world experiments

                  information matrix is exactly sparse in a
                  delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in
                  view-based representations of the environment that
                  rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain
                  virtual observations of robot motion with respect to
                  a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness
                  of the delayed-state information matrix is in
                  contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM
                  information algorithms, such as sparse extended
                  information filter or thin junction-tree filter,
                  since these methods have to make approximations in

  Abstract =	 {This paper addresses the problem of segmenting an
                  image into regions. We define a predicate for
                  measuring the evidence for a boundary between two
                  regions using a graph-based representation of the
                  image. We then develop an efficient segmentation
                  algorithm based on this predicate, and show that
                  although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it
                  produces segmentations that satisfy global
                  properties. We apply the algorithm to image
                  segmentation using two different kinds of local
                  neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and
                  illustrate the results with both real and synthetic
                  images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in
                  the number of graph edges and is also fast in
                  practice. An important characteristic of the method
                  is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability
                  image regions while ignoring detail in
                  high-variability regions.},

  Abstract =	 {Autonomous vehicles require the ability to build
                  maps of an unknown environment while concurrently
                  using these maps for navigation. Current algorithms
                  for this concurrent mapping and localization (CML)
                  problem have been implemented for single vehicles,
                  but do not account for extra positional information
                  available when multiple vehicles operate
                  simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential
                  to map an environment more quickly and robustly than
                  a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative
                  CML algorithm that merges sensor and navigation
                  information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The
                  algorithm presented is based on stochastic
                  estimation and uses a feature-based approach to
                  extract landmarks from the environment. The
                  theoretical framework for the collaborative CML
                  algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem
                  central to the cooperative CML problem is proved for
                  the first time. This theorem quanti£es the
                  performance gains of collaboration, allowing for
                  determination of the number of cooperating vehicles
                  required to accomplish a task. A simulated
                  implementation of the collaborative CML algorithm
                  demonstrates substantial performance improvement
                  over non-cooperative CML.},

  C-Alireza =	 {Fiducial marker systems consist of patterns that are
                  mounted in the environment and automatically
                  detected in digital camera images using an
                  accompanying detection algorithm. They are useful
                  for augmented reality (AR), robot navigation, and
                  general applications where the relative pose between
                  a camera and object is required. Important
                  parameters for such marker systems is their false
                  detection rate (false positive rate), their
                  inter-marker confusion rate, minimal detection size
                  (in pixels) and immunity to lighting
                  variation. ARTag is a marker system that uses
                  digital coding theory to get a very low false
                  positive and inter-marker confusion rate with a
                  small required marker size, employing an edge
                  linking method to give robust lighting variation
                  immunity. ARTag markers are bi-tonal planar patterns
                  containing a unique ID number encoded with robust
                  digital techniques of checksums and forward error
                  correction (FEC). This proposed new system, ARTag
                  has very low and numerically quantifiable error
                  rates, does not require a grey scale threshold as
                  does other marker systems, and can encode up to 2002
                  different unique ID's with no need to store
                  patterns. Experimental results are shown validating
                  this system.},

  Review =	 {More than one third of the human brain is devoted to
                  the processes of seeing - vision is after all the
                  main way in which we gather information about the
                  world. But human vision is a dynamic process during
                  which the eyes continually sample the
                  environment. Where most books on vision consider it
                  as a passive activity, this book is unique in
                  focusing on vision as an 'active' process. It goes
                  beyond most accounts of vision where the focus is on
                  seeing, to provide an integrated account of seeing
                  AND looking. The book starts by pointing out the
                  weaknesses in our traditional approaches to vision
                  and the reason we need this new approach. It then
                  gives a thorough description of basic details of the
                  visual and oculomotor systems necessary to
                  understand active vision. The book goes on to show
                  how this approach can give a new perspective on
                  visual attention, and how the approach has
                  progressed in the areas of visual orienting,
                  reading, visual search, scene perception and
                  neuropsychology. Finally, the book summarises
                  progress by showing how this approach sheds new
                  light on the old problem of how we maintain
                  perception of a stable visual world. Written by two
                  leading vision scientists, this book will be
                  valuable for vision researchers and psychology
                  students, from undergraduate level upwards.},

                  emphasized by various authors [3,4], gaze activity
                  is generally under tight cognitive control from
                  high-level plans. Only very occasionally did the
                  eyes appear possibly to stray to a distracting
                  visually salient object. .. Human observers are
                  loath to make use of internalised visual memory,
                  rather using the alternative option of accessing
                  visual information in the external environment
                  whenever it is needed. .. This transfer of the same
                  behaviour from the eyes to the head suggests that
                  active vision processes can be transferred from one
                  motor system to another.},

                  Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (Ft Lauderdale,
                  Florida; May 1998). M. Land, et al and R. Steinman,

                  behavior involving the constant reflection of the

                  the visual field, with the gaze direction changing
                  several times each second. The findings of these
                  bodies of research are discussed.},

                  approach has the highly desirable property of
                  robustness to data association errors. Another
                  important advantage of our algorithm is that
                  non-linearities are computed exactly, so that global
                  constraints can be imposed even if they result in
                  large shifts to the map. We represent the map as a
                  graph and use the graph to find an efficient map
                  update algorithm. We also show how topological
                  consistency can be imposed on the map, such as,
                  closing a loop. The algorithm has been implemented
                  on an outdoor robot and we have experimental
                  validation of our ideas. We also explain how the
                  graph can be simplified leading to linear
                  approximations of sections of the map. This
                  reduction gives us a natural way to connect local
                  map patches into a much larger global map.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we describe an approach to feature
                  representation for simultaneous localization and

                  features that addresses symmetries and constraints
                  in the feature coordinates. Furthermore, the
                  representation allows for the features to be added
                  to the map with partial initialization. This is an
                  important property when using oriented vision
                  features where angle information can be used before
                  their full pose is known. The number of the
                  dimensions for a feature can grow with time as more
                  information is acquired. At the same time as the
                  special properties of each type of feature are
                  accounted for, the commonalities of all map features
                  are also exploited to allow SLAM algorithms to be
                  interchanged as well as choice of sensors and
                  features. In other words the SLAM implementation
                  need not be changed at all when changing sensors and
                  features and vice versa. Experimental results both

                  constraints in the feature coordinates, the
                  measurement subspace, M-space. The graphical method
                  has the advantages of delayed linearizations and
                  soft commitment to feature measurement matching. It
                  also allows large maps to be built up as a network
                  of small local patches, star nodes. This local map
                  net is then easier to work with. The formation of
                  the star nodes is explicitly stable and invariant

                  normal graph of a normalized generalized state
                  realization has the same topology as the factor
                  graph of the original realization. ... A code is any
                  subset of a symbol configuration space. ... Symbol
                  variables are visible (manifest, observable),
                  whereas state variables are hidden (latent,
                  unobservable). ... Because of these degree
                  restrictions, a normal realization has a natural
                  graphical model that is different from a factor
                  graph, which we call a normal graph. In a normal
                  graph, variables are represented by edges and
                  constraints by vertices.},

                  paper we present an approach to distributed
                  multi-robot mapping and exploration. Our system
                  enables teams of robots to efciently explore
                  environments from different, unknown locations. In
                  order to ensure consistency when combining their
                  data into shared maps, the robots actively seek to
                  verify their relative locations. Using shared maps,
                  they coordinate their exploration strategies so as
                  to maximize the efciency of exploration. Our system
                  was evaluated under extremely realistic real-world
                  conditions. An outside evaluation team found the
                  system to be highly efcient and robust. The maps
                  generated by our approach are consistently more
                  accurate than those generated by manually measuring

  Abstract =	 { In the past decade, a large number of robots has
                  been built that explicitly implement biological
                  navigation behaviours. We review these biomimetic
                  approaches using a framework that allows for a
                  common description of biological and technical
                  navigation behaviour. The review shows that
                  biomimetic systems make significant contributions to
                  two fields of research: First, they provide a real
                  world test of models of biological navigation
                  behaviour; second, they make new navigation
                  mechanisms available for technical applications,
                  most notably in the field of indoor robot
                  navigation. While simpler insect navigation
                  behaviours have been implemented quite successfully,
                  the more complicated way-finding capabilities of
                  vertebrates still pose a challenge to current
                  systems.},

                  landmarks. Ants, for instance, may learn to always
                  pass a landmark on the right side. .. Bees are able
                  to learn routes, i.e., connected chains of
                  recognition-triggered responses. .. biological
                  systems seem to construct topological
                  representations by integrating routes in a bottom-up
                  manner [38]. This ability has been observed in many
                  animals, ranging from honeybees [16] to humans
                  [21]. ..The above described robot systems show that,
                  mostly within the last five years, biomimetic
                  approaches have been developed for most types of
                  biological navigation, with the exception of search
                  and survey navigation. However, the field is still
                  at the beginning of its development. This is
                  documented by the fact that all of the reviewed
                  approaches aim at testing biological models or
                  mechanisms rather than at finding an optimal
                  technical solution to a given problem. .. From the
                  bionic point of view, biomimetic research has
                  yielded a number of interesting new navigation
                  mechanisms. In particular, corridor-following based
                  on optic flow, path integration with a polarization
                  compass, snapshot-based guidance and
                  recognition-triggered responses are now well
                  understood. .. Before a biomimetic survey navigation
                  system can be built, the hurdle of topological
                  navigation has to be taken. Although the principle
                  problems are well understood, there is currently no
                  system that autonomously builds graphs from routes
                  in a larger scale environment. In our opinion,
                  reliable topological navigation could be the
                  challenge of the near future. Once this is achieved,
                  a number of interesting questions concerning survey
                  navigation can be addressed; for instance, how the
                  topological representation should be embedded in a
                  common reference frame, or how much metric
                  information is necessary for this behaviour. A
                  biomimetic robot capable of survey navigation would
                  finally close the loop that began with abandoning
                  the traditional map-based navigation systems.},

                  by local views of the surrounding scene, and finds
                  traversable paths between them. The set of recorded
                  views and their connections are combined into a
                  graph model of the environment. To navigate between
                  views connected in the graph, we employ a homing
                  strategy inspired by findings of insect ethology. In
                  robot experiments, we demonstrate that complex
                  visual exploration and navigation tasks can thus be

  Abstract =	 {This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous
                  localisation and mapping (SLAM) by a mobile
                  robot. An incremental SLAM algorithm is introduced
                  that is derived from socalled multigrid methods used
                  for solving partial differential equations. The
                  approach overcomes the relatively slow convergence
                  of previous relaxation methods because it optimizes
                  the map at multiple levels of resolution. The
                  resulting algorithm has an update time that is
                  linear in the number of mapped features, even when
                  closing very large loops, and offers advantages in
                  handling non-linearities compared to previous
                  approaches. Experimental comparisons with
                  alternative algorithms using two well-known data

  Abstract =	 {``Background subtraction'' is an old technique for
                  finding moving objects in a video sequence---for
                  example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that
                  subtracting the current image from a time-averaged
                  background image will leave only nonstationary
                  objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to
                  the task of classifying each pixel of the current
                  image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does
                  not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The
                  basic idea of this paper is that we can classify
                  each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks
                  when it is part of different classes. We learn a
                  mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each
                  pixel using an unsupervised technique---an
                  efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the
                  standard image-averaging approach, this
                  automatically updates the mixture component for each
                  class according to likelihood of membership; hence
                  slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our
                  approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much
                  more effectively than other techniques such as
                  thresholding. Application of this method as part of
                  the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is
                  expected to result in significant improvements in
                  vehicle identification and tracking.},

  Abstract =	 {Autonomous mobile agents require object recognition
                  for high level interpretation and localization in
                  complex scenes. In urban environments, recognition
                  of buildings might play a dominant role in robotic
                  systems that need object based navigation, that take
                  advantage of visual feedback and multimodal
                  information for self-localization, or that enable
                  association to related information from the
                  identified semantics. We present a new method "the
                  informative local features approach" based on an
                  information theoretic saliency measure that is
                  rapidly derived from a local Parzen window density
                  estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of
                  a decision tree based mapping to informative
                  features, it enables attentive access to
                  discriminative information and thereby significantly
                  speeds up the recognition process. This approach is
                  highly robust with respect to severe degrees of
                  partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some
                  changes in scale and illumination. We present
                  performance evaluation on our publicly available
                  reference object database (TSG-20) that demonstrates
                  the efficiency of this approach, case wise even
                  outperforming the SIFT feature approach. Building
                  recognition will be advantageous in various
                  application domains, such as, mobile mapping,
                  unmanned vehicle navigation, and systems for car

@article{Fulkerson65pjm,
  Abstract =	 {According to present genetic theory, the fine
                  structure of genes consists of linearly ordered
                  elements. A mutant gene is obtained by alteration of
                  some connected portion of this structure. By
                  examining data obtained from suitable experiments,
                  it can be determined whether or not the blemished
                  portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and
                  thus intersection data for a large number of mutants
                  can be represented as an undirected graph. If this
                  graph is an "interval graph", then the observed data
                  are consistent with a linear model of the
                  gene. Given a family of sets $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n$,
                  one can form the intersection graph of the family by
                  associating a vertex of the graph with each set and
                  joining two distinct vertices with an edge if their
                  corresponding sets have a nonempty
                  intersection. Conversely, any finite graph can, of
                  course, be viewed as the intersection graph of a
                  family of sets (in many ways). If each set can be
                  taken as an interval on the real line, the graph is
                  called an interval graph. The problem of determining
                  when a graph is an interval graph is a special case
                  of the following problem concerning
                  $(0,1)$-matrices: When can the rows of such a matrix
                  be permuted so as to make the 1's in each column
                  appear consecutively? A complete theory is obtained
                  for this latter problem, culminating in a
                  decomposition theorem which leads to a rapid
                  algorithm for deciding the question, and for
                  constructing the desired permutation when one
                  exists.},

  Abstract =	 {Background modeling is a common component in video
                  surveillance systems and is used to quickly identify
                  regions of interest. To increase the robustness of
                  background subtraction techniques, researchers have
                  developed techniques to update the background model
                  and also developed probabilistic/statistical
                  approaches for thresholding the difference. This
                  paper presents an error analysis of this type of
                  background modeling and pixel labeling, providing
                  both theoretical analysis and experimental
                  validation. Evaluation is cen- tered around the
                  tradeoff of probability of false alarm and
                  probability of miss detection, and this paper shows
                  how to efficiently compute these probabilities from
                  simpler values that are more easily measured. It
                  includes an analysis for both static and dynamic
                  background modeling. The paper also examines the
                  assumptions of Gaussian and mixture of Gaussian
                  models for a pixel. },

  Abstract =	 {This paper proposes a method for the visual-based
                  navigation of a mobile robot in indoor environments,
                  using a single omni-directional (catadioptric)
                  camera. The geometry of the catadioptric sensor and
                  the method used to obtain a bird? eye (orthographic)
                  view of the ground plane are presented. This
                  representation significantly simplifies the solution
                  to navigation problems, by eliminating any
                  perspective effects. The nature of each navigation
                  taskis taken into account when designing the
                  required navigation skills and environmental
                  representations. We propose two main navigation
                  modalities: Topological Navigation and Visual Path
                  Following. Topological Navigation is used for
                  traveling long distances and does not require
                  knowledge of the exact position of the robot but
                  rather, a qualitative position on the topological
                  map. The navigation process combines appearance
                  based methods and visual servoing upon some
                  environmental features. Visual Path Following is
                  required for local, very precise navigation, for
                  e.g. door traversal, docking. The robot is
                  controlled to follow a pre-specified path
                  accurately, by tracking visual landmarks in bird?
                  eye views of the ground plane. By clearly separating
                  the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and
                  yet powerful navigation system is obtained.},

                  divide-and-conquer computational paradigm. Alan
                  George is credited for having used this technique in
                  1973 to solve systems of linear equations [15]. His
                  algorithm, termed nested dissection, was later
                  generalized [21] and applied to other problems, such
                  as network reliability [27].},
  R-Mathscinet = {The author considers a system of $(n+1)^2$ linear
                  equations $Ax=b$ derived, for example, from a
                  regular $n\times n$ mesh used in solving
                  self-adjoint elliptic boundary value problems. It is
                  assumed that $A$ is symmetric, positive definite,
                  and has a particular zero-nonzero structure
                  associated with such boundary value problems. No
                  further assumptions are made regarding the values of
                  the nonzero elements of $A$. Using a particular
                  ordering, the author shows that $A$ can be factored
                  in $O(n^3)$ operations and that the lower triangular
                  factor must have $O(n^2\ln_2n)$ nonzero
                  components. Since these bounds have been shown by
                  A. J. Hoffman, M. S. Martin and D. J. Rose [same
                  issue] to be lower bounds, it follows that the given

  Abstract =	 {Over the past fifteen years, the implementation of
                  the minimum degree algorithm has received much
                  study, and many important enhancements have been
                  made to it. This paper describes these various
                  enhancements, their historical development, and some
                  experiments showing how very effective they are in
                  improving the execution time of the algorithm. A
                  shortcoming is also presented that exists in all of
                  the widely used implementations of the algorithm,
                  namely, that the quality of the ordering provided by
                  the implementations is surprisingly sensitive to the
                  initial ordering. For example, changing the input
                  ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as
                  much as a factor of three in the cost of the
                  subsequent numerical factorization. This sensitivity
                  is caused by the lack of an effective tie-breaking
                  strategy, and the authors' experiments illustrate
                  the importance of developing such a strategy.},

  Abstract =	 {A general theory of locomotor behaviour in relation
                  to physical objects is presented. Since the
                  controlling stimulation for such behaviour is mainly
                  optical, this involves novel assumptions about
                  object perception and about what is called 'visual
                  kinaesthesis'. Evidence for these assumptions is
                  cited. On the basis of this theory it is possible to
                  suppose that animals are visually oriented to the
                  surfaces of their environment, not merely to light
                  as such. In short, it is possible to explain why
                  they seem to have space perception. Implications of
                  this approach for maze-learning are pointed out.},

  R-Findlay04Cb ={If eye movements are so important for vision, it
                  might be expected that their loss would be
                  catastrophic. An opportunity arose recently
                  \cite{Gilchrist97nature} to examine this proposition
                  in an individual who was born without functional eye
                  muscles. The eyes of this unusual individual are
                  fixed in her head. Surprisingly she is hardly
                  impaired; she reads well and leads a normal life as
                  a university student. At first glance, this might
                  appear to support the traditional approach to
                  studying vision; after all she gets on perfectly
                  well without eye movements. It turns out, however,
                  that in visual tasks she makes head scanning
                  movements with comparable properties to the eye
                  movements of an unimpaired subject. This transfer of
                  the same behaviour from the eyes to the head
                  suggests that active vision processes can be
                  transferred from one motor system to another. Active
                  vision is crucially dependent upon orienting
                  movements, but these do not need to be eye
                  movements.},

  Abstract =	 {A new and fast way to find local image
                  correspondences for wide baseline image matching is
                  described. The targeted application is visual
                  navigation, e.g. of a semi-automatic
                  wheelchair. Such applications pose some additional
                  requirements, like the need to work with natural
                  landmarks rather than artificial markers, and the
                  need to recognize locations fast. The restricted
                  motion of the camera can be exploited to simplify
                  the feature extraction. These features should
                  support their identification from different, but
                  nevertheless restricted viewing directions, and
                  under variable illumination conditions. The paper
                  proposes a specialization of so-called affine
                  invariant regions for these particular conditions,
                  which in this case simplifies to column
                  segments. Their applicability is wider than robot
                  navigation, and includes localization for wearable

  Abstract =	 {Vision sensors are attractive for autonomous robots
                  because they are a rich source of environment
                  information. The main challenge in using images for
                  mobile robots is managing this wealth of
                  information. A relatively recent approach is the use
                  of fast wide baseline local features, which we
                  developed and used in the novel approach to sparse
                  visual path following described in this paper. These
                  local features have the great advantage that they
                  can be recognized even if the viewpoint differs
                  significantly. This opens the door to a memory
                  efficient description of a path by descriptors of
                  sparse images. We propose a method for re-execution
                  of these paths by a series of visual homing
                  operations which yield a navigation method with
                  unique properties: it is accurate, robust, fast, and

  Abstract =	 {One can partition the class of relational database
                  schemas into tree schemas and cyclic schemas. (These
                  are called acyclic hypergraphs and cyclic
                  hypergraphs elsewhere in the literature.) This
                  partition has interesting implications in query
                  processing, dependency theory, and graph theory. The
                  tree/cyclic partitioning of database schemas
                  originated with a similar partition of equijoin
                  queries. Given an arbitrary equijoin query one can
                  obtain an equivalent query that calculates the
                  natural join of all relations in (an efficiently)
                  derived database; such a query is called a natural
                  join (NJ) query. If the derived database is a tree
                  schema the original query is said to be a tree
                  query, and otherwise a cyclic query. In this paper
                  we analyze query processing consequences of the
                  tree/cyclic partitioning. We are able to argue,
                  qualitatively, that queries which imply a tree
                  schema are easier to process than those implying a
                  cyclic schema. Our results also extend the study of

                  satisfaction problems (CSPs). We first give a
                  uniform presentation of the major structural CSP
                  decomposition methods. We then introduce a new class
                  of tractable CSPs based on the concept of hypertree
                  decomposition recently developed in Database Theory,
                  and analyze the cost of solving CSPs having bounded
                  hypertree-width. We provide a framework for
                  comparing parametric decomposition-based methods
                  according to tractability criteria and compare the
                  most relevant methods. We show that the method of
                  hypertree decomposition dominates the others in the
                  case of general CSPs (i.e., CSPs of unbounded
                  arity). We also make comparisons for the restricted

                  application of decomposition methods to the dual
                  graph of a hypergraph. In fact, this technique is
                  often used to exploit binary decomposition methods
                  for nonbinary CSPs. However, even in this case, the

  Abstract =	 {This paper addresses the problem of data fusion in
                  decentralized sensor networks in which there is no
                  central fusion center and in which no single sensor
                  node has global knowledge of network topology. An
                  algorlthm is described which is able to locally
                  process and assimilate data in such networks and
                  which yields an identical result to that obtained in
                  a centralized system. An implementation of this
                  decentralized data fusion algorithm on a process
                  control rig incorporating over 150 sensors and 30
                  processors is described. The results show that the
                  decentralized data fusion system described in this
                  paper offers many advantages in terms of robustness,
                  scalability and flexibility over a centralized

                  estimator guarantees that tree-connected networks of

                  connected networks or centralized data fusion
                  systems. For more general sensor networks with
                  multiple paths between nodes, it is shown that
                  within the constraints imposed, there is no finite
                  set of estimators that will, in general, allow the
                  local computation of an estimate equivalent to the
                  centralized estimate. [...] The information filter
                  is directly an implementation of Bayes theorem in
                  terms of log-likelihood rather than in terms of
                  state. For this reason, it is occasionally referred
                  to as the likelihood filter. [The log likelihoods]
                  may simply be summed to yield the posterior
                  log-likelihood [which] provides a far more natural
                  method of aggregating data than does the
                  conventional Kalman filter. [Similar data fusion
                  methods] may be applied to cases when the underlying
                  probabilities are not Gaussian, and indeed in cases
                  where the underlying state-space is discrete. These
                  cases lead directly to an information theory
                  approach to data fusion as described in (Manyika and

  Abstract =	 {Recently Rao-Blackwellized particle lters have been
                  introduced as effective means to solve the
                  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
                  problem. This approach uses a particle lter in which
                  each particle carries an individual map of the
                  environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to
                  reduce the number of particles. In this paper we
                  present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of
                  particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle lter for
                  learning grid maps. We propose an approach to
                  compute an accurate proposal distribution taking
                  into account not only the movement of the robot but
                  also the most recent observation. This drastically
                  decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in
                  the prediction step of the lter. Furthermore, we
                  present an approach to selectively carry out
                  re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the
                  problem of particle depletion. Experimental results
                  carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor
                  as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the
                  advantages of our methods over previous approaches.},

  Abstract =	 {In 2006, Olson et al. presented a novel approach to
                  address the graph-based simultaneous localization
                  and mapping problem by applying stochastic gradient
                  descent to minimize the error introduced by
                  constraints. Together with multi-level relaxation,
                  this is one of the most robust and efficient maximum
                  likelihood techniques published so far. In this
                  paper, we present an extension of Olson?
                  algorithm. It applies a novel parameterization of
                  the nodes in the graph that significantly improves
                  the performance and enables us to cope with
                  arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us
                  to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size
                  of the mapped area and not to the length of the

  Abstract =	 {Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF)
                  have been introduced as an effective means to solve
                  the simultaneous localization and mapping
                  problem. This approach uses a particle filter in
                  which each particle carries an individual map of the
                  environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to
                  reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we
                  present adaptive techniques for reducing this number
                  in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an
                  approach to compute an accurate proposal
                  distribution, taking into account not only the
                  movement of the robot, but also the most recent
                  observation. This drastically decreases the
                  uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction
                  step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an
                  approach to selectively carry out resampling
                  operations, which seriously reduces the problem of
                  particle depletion. Experimental results carried out
                  with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as
                  well as outdoor, environments illustrate the
                  advantages of our methods over previous approaches},

  Abstract =	 {Learning models of the environment is one of the
                  fundamental tasks of mobile robots since maps are
                  needed for a wide range of robotic applications,
                  such as navigation and transportation tasks, service
                  robotic applications, and several others. In the
                  past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning
                  have been proposed. Most of them, however, assume
                  that the robot lives on a plane. In this paper, we
                  present a highly efficient maximum likelihood
                  approach that is able to solve 3D as well as 2D
                  problems. Our approach addresses the so-called
                  graph-based formulation of the simultaneous
                  localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as
                  an extension of Olson's algorithm towards non-flat
                  environments. It applies a novel parameterization of
                  the nodes of the graph that significantly improves
                  the performance of the algorithm and can cope with
                  arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us
                  to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size
                  of the mapped area and not to the length of the
                  trajectory. Furthermore, our approach is able to
                  appropriately distribute the roll, pitch and yaw
                  error over a sequence of poses in 3D mapping
                  problems. We implemented our technique and compared
                  it to multiple other graph-based SLAM solutions. As
                  we demonstrate in simulated and in real world
                  experiments, our method converges faster than the
                  other approaches and yields accurate maps of the
                  environment.},

                  hypotheses as are typical for real-world

  Abstract =	 {This work addresses real time implementation of the
                  Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM)
                  algorithm. It presents optimal algorithms that
                  consider the special form of the matrices and a new
                  compressed filter that can significantly reduce the
                  computation requirements when working in local areas
                  or with high frequency external sensors. It is shown
                  that by extending the standard Kalman filter models
                  the information gained in a local area can be
                  maintained with a cost O(Na^2), where Na is the
                  number of landmarks in the local area, and then
                  transferred to the overall map in only one iteration
                  at full SLAM computational cost. Additional
                  simplifications are also presented that are very
                  close to optimal when an appropriate map
                  representation is used. Finally the algorithms are
                  validated with experimental results obtained with a
                  standard vehicle running in a completely
                  unstructured outdoor environment.},

  Abstract =	 {Learning visual classifiers for object recognition
                  from weakly labeled data requires determining
                  correspondence between image regions and semantic
                  object classes. Most approaches use co-occurrence of
                  nouns� and image features over large datasets to
                  determine the correspondence, but many
                  correspondence ambiguities remain. We further
                  constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting
                  additional language constructs to improve the
                  learning process from weakly labeled data. We
                  consider both �prepositions� and comparative
                  adjectives� which are used to express relationships
                  between objects. If the models of such relationships
                  can be determined, they help resolve correspondence
                  ambiguities. However, learning models of these
                  relationships requires solving the correspondence
                  problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features
                  defining �nouns� and the differential visual
                  features defining such binary-relationships� using
                  an EM-based approach.},

  Abstract =	 {Many motion detection and tracking algorithms rely
                  on the process of background subtraction, a
                  technique which f detects changes from a model of
                  the background scene. We present a new algorithm for
                  the purpose of background model initialization. The
                  algorithm takes as input a video sequence in which
                  moving objects are present, and outputs a
                  statistical background model describing the static
                  parts of the scene. Multiple hypotheses of the
                  background value at each pixel are generated by
                  locating periods o stable f intensity in the
                  sequence. The likelihood of each hypothesis is then
                  evaluated using optical flow information from the
                  neighborhood around the pixel, and the most likely
                  hypothesis is chosen to represent the
                  background. Our results are compared with those of
                  several standard background modeling techniques

  Abstract =	 {Mobile robots can use geometric or topological maps
                  of their environment to navigate reliably. Automatic
                  creation of such maps is still an unrealized goal,
                  especially in environments that have large cyclical
                  structures. Drawing on recent techniques of global
                  registration and correlation, we present a method,
                  called Local Registration and Global Correlation
                  (LRGC), for reliable reconstruction of consistent
                  global maps from dense range data. The method is
                  attractive because it is incremental, producing an
                  updated map with every new sensor input; and runs in
                  constant time independent of the size of the map
                  (except when closing large cycles). A real-time
                  implementation and results are presented for several
                  indoor environments.},

  Abstract =	 {A two-stage method of image segmentation based on
                  gray level cooccurrence matrices is described. An
                  analysis of the distributions within a cooccurrence
                  matrix defines an initial pixel classification into
                  both region and interior or boundary
                  designations. Local consistency of pixel
                  classification is then implemented by minimizing the
                  entropy of local information, where region
                  information is expressed via conditional
                  probabilities estimated from the cooccurrence
                  matrices, and boundary information via conditional
                  probabilities which are determined a priori. The
                  method robustly segments an image into homogeneous
                  areas and generates an edge map. The technique
                  extends easily to general edge operators. An example

  Abstract =	 {The ability to learn a consistent model of its
                  environment is a prerequisite for autonomous mobile
                  robots. A particularly challenging problem in
                  acquiring environment maps is that of closing loops;
                  loops in the environment create challenging data
                  association problems [9]. This paper presents a
                  novel algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized
                  particle filtering and scan matching. In our
                  approach scan matching is used for minimizing
                  odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic
                  model of the residual errors of scan matching
                  process is then used for the resampling steps. This
                  way the number of samples required is seriously
                  reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the particle
                  depletion problem that typically prevents the robot
                  from closing large loops. We present extensive
                  experiments that illustrate the superior performance
                  of our approach compared to previous approaches.},

  Abstract =	 {The problem of generating maps with mobile robots
                  has received considerable attention over the past
                  years. Most of the techniques developed so far have
                  been designed for situations in which the
                  environment is static during the mapping
                  process. Dynamic objects, however, can lead to
                  serious errors in the resulting maps such as
                  spurious objects or misalignments due to
                  localization errors. In this paper we consider the
                  problem of creating maps with mobile robots in
                  dynamic environments. We present a new approach that
                  interleaves mapping and localization with a
                  probabilistic technique to identify spurious
                  measurements. In several experiments we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm generates accurate 2d and 3d in
                  different kinds of dynamic indoor and outdoor
                  environments. We also use our algorithm to isolate
                  the dynamic objects and to generate
                  three-dimensional representation of them.},

  Abstract =	 {In the current study, we explored observers' use of
                  two distinct analyses for determining their
                  direction of motion, or heading: a scene-based
                  analysis and a motion-based analysis. In two
                  experiments, subjects viewed sequentially presented,
                  paired digitized images of real-world scenes and
                  judged the direction of heading; the pairs were
                  presented with various interstimulus intervals
                  (ISIs). In Experiment 1, subjects could determine
                  heading when the two frames were separated with a
                  1,000-ms ISI, long enough to eliminate apparent
                  motion. In Experiment 2, subjects performed two
                  tasks, a path-of-motion task and a memory-load task,
                  under three different ISIs, 50 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000
                  ms. Heading accuracy decreased with an increase in
                  ISI. Increasing memory load influenced heading
                  judgments only for the longer ISI when motion-based
                  information was not available. These results are
                  consistent with the hypothesis that the scene-based
                  analysis has a coarse spatial representation, is a

                  analysis is a transient system that updates
                  information very rapidly. .. In contrast, the
                  scene-based analysis is a sustained system in which

  Abstract =	 {Density-based modeling of visual features is very
                  common in computer vision, either by using
                  non-parametric techniques or through representing
                  the underlying density function as a weighted sum of
                  Gaussians. A number of real-time tasks such as
                  background modeling or modeling the appearance of a
                  moving target require sequential density estimation,
                  where new data is incorporated in the model as it
                  becomes available. Nevertheless, current methods for
                  updating the density function either lack
                  flexibility, by fixing the number of Gaussians in
                  the mixture, or require large memory amounts, by
                  maintaining a non-parametric representation of the
                  den- sity. This paper presents an efficient method
                  for recursive density approximation that relies on
                  the propagation of the density modes. At each time
                  step, the modes of the density are re-estimated and
                  a Gaussian component is assigned to each mode. The
                  covariance of each component is derived from the
                  Hessian matrix estimated at the mode location. To
                  detect the modes we employ the variable-bandwidth
                  mean shift. While the proposed density
                  representation is memory efficient (which is typical
                  for mixture densities), it inherits the flexibility
                  of non-parametric methods, by allowing the number of
                  modes to adapt in time. We show that the same mode
                  propagation principle applies for subspaces derived
                  from eigen analysis. Extensive experimental
                  background modeling results demonstrate the
                  performance of the method. },

                  processing tasks that are amenable to multiprocessor
                  implementation are described. The natural origins of
                  such multitasking are emphasized, and novel parallel
                  structures for state estimation using the Kalman
                  filter are proposed that extend existing results in
                  several directions. In particular, hierarchical
                  network structures are developed that have the
                  property that the optimal global estimate based on
                  all the available information can be reconstructed
                  from estimates computed by local processor nodes
                  solely on the basis of their own local information
                  and transmitted to a central processor. The

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents the case for a functional
                  account of vision. A variety of studies have
                  consistently revealed ?hange blindness?or
                  insensitivity to changes in the visual scene during
                  an eye movement. These studies indicate that only a
                  small part of the information in the scene is
                  represented in the brain from moment to moment. It
                  is still unclear, however, exactly what is included
                  in visual representations. This paper reviews
                  experiments using an extended visuo-motor task,
                  showing that display changes affect performance
                  differently depending on the observer? place in the
                  task. These effects are revealed by increases in
                  fixation duration following a change. Different
                  task-dependent increases suggest that the visual
                  system represents only the information that is
                  necessary for the immediate visual task. This allows
                  a principled exploration of the stimulus properties
                  that are included in the internal visual
                  representation. The task specificity also has a more
                  general implication that vision should be
                  conceptualized as an active process executing
                  special purpose ?outines?that compute only the
                  currently necessary information. Evidence for this
                  view and its implications for visual representations
                  are discussed. Comparison of the change blindness
                  phenomenon and fixation durations shows that
                  conscious report does not reveal the extent of the
                  representations computed by the routines.},

                  little room for other functions. Performance is also
                  highly serialized. .. Another compelling feature of
                  the behaviour was the similarity between
                  subjects. .. The crucial advantage of task-specific
                  routines is computational efficiency. .. In the case
                  of human vision the retinal image is changing every
                  several hundred milliseconds as the observer changes
                  gaze. Thus, the relevant information must be
                  extracted very quickly. .. Direction of gaze can be
                  used to specify the location of the needed
                  information in the visual scene and the time when it
                  is needed. This makes complex internal
                  representations unnecessary because the
                  observer/autonomous system can acquire the necessary
                  information from the scene during performance of the
                  task, rather than using the information inherent in
                  an internal model. .. The computational advantage of
                  task specific representations comes at a cost. A
                  crucial problem for any system like this is: How are
                  more complex behaviours composed using the
                  individual routines? That is, how is the scheduling
                  of the individual routines handled? .. What, then,
                  can we conclude about the content of visual
                  representations from the change blindness work and
                  the results described here? [] The general consensus
                  [] is that the visual information retained after a
                  change in fixation position is very limited.},

  Abstract =	 {The classic experiments of Yarbus over 50 years ago
                  revealed that saccadic eye movements reflect
                  cognitive processes. But it is only recently that
                  three separate advances have greatly expanded our
                  understanding of the intricate role of eye movements
                  in cognitive function. The first is the
                  demonstration of the pervasive role of the task in
                  guiding where and when to fixate. The second has
                  been the recognition of the role of internal reward
                  in guiding eye and body movements, revealed
                  especially in neurophysiological studies. The third
                  important advance has been the theoretical
                  developments in the fields of reinforcement learning
                  and graphic simulation. All of these advances are
                  proving crucial for understanding how behavioral

                  realistic models of eye movements over extended time
                  scales. This has shifted the focus of experimental
                  understanding from where in a scene the eyes fixate
                  in an image, to why the eyes choose a location in a
                  scene, and when they choose it. .. The most novel
                  finding of task-oriented studies is that the eyes
                  are positioned at a point that is not the most
                  visually salient, but is the best for the
                  spatio-temporal demands of the job that needs to be
                  done. This line of investigation has been used in
                  extended visuo-motor tasks such as driving, walking,
                  sports, and making tea or sandwiches[]. .. Not only
                  is the sequence of fixations tightly linked to the
                  task, but in addition, fixations appear to have the
                  purpose of obtaining quite specific
                  information. .. In driving, Shinoda et al. [42]
                  showed that approximately 45\% of fixations fell
                  close to intersections. As a consequence of this,
                  subjects were more likely to notice ?top?signs
                  located at intersections as opposed to signs in the
                  middle of a block, suggesting in turn that subjects
                  have learnt that traffic signs are more likely
                  around intersections. .. The value of VR is that it
                  allows the creation of human models that implement
                  complex visuo-motor loops for the control of
                  temporally extended behaviors. .. One of the
                  principal findings of these simulations is that the
                  informationfromfixations supports behavior
                  indifferent ways. In this respect is very helpful to
                  think of the visual computations that need to be
                  done as hierarchically organized, a viewpoint that
                  has not been as obvious from the
                  attention/working-memory dichotomy. Table 1 shows
                  the basic elements of a representative hierarchy
                  that has three levels ?Behavior, Arbitration and
                  Context ?highlighting the different roles of vision
                  at each level. .. The mental programs that drive
                  gaze selection are increasingly seen to be
                  reward-based.},

  Abstract =	 {A new model for dynamic programming and branch and
                  bound algorithms is presented. The model views these
                  algorithms as utilizing computationally feasible
                  dominance relations to infer the orderings of
                  application objects, thereby implicitly enumerating
                  a finite solution space. The formalism is broad
                  enough to apply the computational strategies of
                  dynamic programming and branch and bound to problems
                  with nonassociative objects, and can model both
                  oblivious and nonoblivious algorithms, as well as
                  parallel algorithms. The model is used to classify
                  computations based, in part, on the types of
                  computationally feasible dominances that they
                  employ. It is demonstrated that the model is
                  computationally precise enough to support the
                  derivation of lower bounds on the number of

                  presents a combination of methods in solving the
                  SLAM problem in a constricted indoor environment
                  using small baseline stereo vision. Main
                  contributions include a feature selection and
                  tracking algorithm, a stereo noise filter, a robust
                  feature validation algorithm and a multiple
                  hypotheses adaptive window positioning method in
                  "closing the loop". These methods take a novel
                  approach in that information from the image
                  processing and robotic navigation domains are used
                  in tandem to augment each other. Experimental
                  results including a real-time implementation in an
                  office-like environment are also presented.},

  Abstract =	 {Camera motion estimation is useful for a range of
                  applications. Usually, feature tracking is performed
                  through the sequence of images to determine
                  correspondences. Furthermore, robust statistical
                  techniques are normally used to handle large number
                  of outliers in correspondences. This paper proposes
                  a new method that avoids both. Motion is calculated
                  between two consecutive stereo images without any
                  pre-knowledge or prediction about feature location
                  or the possibly large camera movement. This permits
                  a lower frame rate and almost arbitrary
                  movements. Euclidean constraints are used to
                  incrementally select inliers from a set of initial
                  correspondences, instead of using robust statistics
                  that has to handle all inliers and outliers
                  together. These constraints are so strong that the
                  set of initial correspondences can contain several
                  times more outliers than inliers. Experiments on a
                  worst-case stereo sequence show that the method is
                  robust, accurate and can be used in real-time.},

  Abstract =	 {The recognition of objects in three-dimensional
                  space is a desirable capability of a computer vision
                  system. Range images, which directly measure 3-D
                  surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for
                  this task. In this paper we report a procedure to
                  detect connected planar, convex, and concave
                  surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in
                  three stages. The first stage segments the range
                  image into ``surface patches'' by a square error
                  criterion clustering algorithm using surface points
                  and associated surface normals. The second stage
                  classifies these patches as planar, convex, or
                  concave based on a non-parametric statistical test
                  for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue
                  analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between
                  adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or
                  noncrease edges, and this information is used to
                  merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces
                  of the object(s). This procedure has been
                  successfully applied to a large number of real and
                  synthetic images, four of which we present in this
                  paper.},

  Abstract =	 {A methodology for evaluating range image
                  segmentation algorithms is proposed. This
                  methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser
                  range finder images and 40 structured light scanner
                  images that have manually specified ground truth and
                  (2) a set of defined performance metrics for
                  instances of correctly segmented, missed, and noise
                  regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy
                  of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to
                  objectively compare a machine generated segmentation
                  against the specified ground truth. Four research

  Abstract =	 {Finding the relationship between two coordinate
                  systems using pairs of measurements of the
                  coordinates of a number of points in both systems is
                  a classic photogrammetric task. It finds
                  applications in stereophotogrammetry and in
                  robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to
                  the least-squares problem for three or more
                  points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and
                  numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation
                  of the solution is simplified by use of unit
                  quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a
                  symmetry property that a solution to this problem
                  ought to possess. The best translational offset is
                  the difference between the centroid of the
                  coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled
                  centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The
                  best scale is equal to the ratio of the
                  root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in
                  the two systems from their respective
                  centroids. These exact results are to be preferred
                  to approximate methods based on measurements of a
                  few selected points. The unit quaternion
                  representing the best rotation is the eigenvector
                  associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a
                  symmetric 4 {\texttimes} 4 matrix. The elements of
                  this matrix are combinations of sums of products of
                  corresponding coordinates of the points.},

                  moving objects from a static background scene that
                  contains shading and shadows using color images. We
                  develop a robust and e ciently computed background
                  subtraction algorithm that is able to cope with
                  local illumination changes, such as shadows and
                  highlights, as well as global illumination
                  changes. The algorithm is based on a proposed
                  computational color model which separates the
                  brightness from the chromaticity component. We have
                  applied this method to real image sequences of both
                  indoor and outdoor scenes. The results, which
                  demonstrate the system's performance, and some speed

  Abstract =	 {The ability of human visual system to detect visual
                  saliency is extraordinarily fast and
                  reliable. However, com- putational modeling of this
                  basic intelligent behavior still remains a
                  challenge. This paper presents a simple method for
                  the visual saliency detection.  Our model is
                  independent of features, categories, or other forms
                  of prior knowledge of the objects. By analyz- ing
                  the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract the
                  spec- tral residual of an image in spectral domain,
                  and propose a fast method to construct the
                  corresponding saliency map in spatial domain.  We
                  test this model on both natural pictures and
                  artificial images such as psychological
                  patterns. The result indicate fast and robust

  Abstract =	 {This paper considers two problems which at first
                  sight appear to be quite distinct: localizing a
                  robot in an unknown environment and calibrating an
                  embedded sensor network.  We show that both of these
                  can be formulated as special cases of a generalized
                  localization problem. In the standard localization
                  problem, the aim is to determine the pose of some
                  object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global
                  coordinate system. In our generalized version, the
                  aim is to determine the pose of all elements in a
                  network (both fixed and mobile) relative to an
                  arbitrary global coordinate system. We have
                  developed a physically inspired "meshbased"
                  formalism for solving such problems. This paper
                  outlines the formalism, and describes its
                  application to the concrete tasks of multi-robot
                  mapping and calibration of a distributed sensor
                  network. The paper presents experimental results for
                  both tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer mobile
                  robots equipped with scanning laser range-finders.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes an algorithm for deploying the
                  members of a mobile robot team into an unknown
                  environment. The algorithm deploys robots

                  information gathered by the previous robots to
                  determine the next deployment location. The
                  deployment pattern is designed to maximize the area

                  of the DARPA SDR (Software for Distributed Robotics)
                  program. The core challenge for this program is to
                  develop a system capable of carrying out
                  'locate-and-protect' missions: the system must be
                  able to deploy a large number of robots into an
                  unexplored building, map the building interior,
                  locate a valued object, detect and track intruders,
                  and transmit all of the above information to a
                  remote observer/operator. To satisfy these
                  requirements, we have developed a large
                  heterogeneous robot team consisting of approximately
                  80 robots. This paper sketches the key technical
                  elements of this system, and presents selected

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a novel representation for
                  two-dimensional maps, and shows how this
                  representation may be applied to the problem of
                  multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping. We
                  are inspired by the notion of a manifold, which
                  takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto
                  a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional
                  space. The key advantage of the manifold
                  representation is selfconsistency: when closing
                  loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the "cross
                  over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This
                  self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of
                  important capabilities, including autonomous
                  exploration, search, and retro-traverse. It also
                  supports a very robust form of loop closure, in
                  which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm or
                  reject possible correspondence points. In this
                  paper, we develop the basic formalism of the
                  manifold representation, show how this may be
                  applied to the multirobot simultaneous localization
                  and mapping problem, and present experimental
                  results obtained from teams of up to four robots in
                  environments ranging in size from 400 to 900 m2.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper provides a novel state vector and
                  covariance sub-matrix recovery algorithm for a
                  recently developed submap based exactly sparse
                  Extended Information Filter (EIF) SLAM algorithm --
                  Sparse Local Submap Joining Filter (SLSJF). The
                  algorithm achieves exact recovery instead of
                  approximate recovery. The recovery algorithm is very
                  efficient because of an incremental Cholesky
                  factorization approach and a natural reordering of
                  the global state vector. Simulation results show
                  that the computation cost of the SLSJF is much lower
                  as compared with the sequential map joining
                  algorithm using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The
                  SLSJF with the proposed recovery algorithm is also
                  successfully applied to the Victoria Park data set.},

  Abstract =	 {To interact effectively with humans, mobile robots
                  will need certain skills. One particularly important
                  skill is the ability to pursue moving agents. To do
                  this, the robot needs a robust visual tracking
                  algorithm and an effective obstacle avoidance
                  algorithm, plus a means of integrating these two
                  behaviors in a seamless manner. In this paper, we
                  introduce the proximity space method as a means for
                  performing real-time, behavior-based control of
                  visual gaze. We then show how this method is
                  integrated with robot motion using an intelligent
                  control architecture that can automatically
                  reconfigure the robot's behaviors in response to
                  environmental changes. The resulting implementation
                  pursues people and other robots around our
                  laboratory for extended periods of time},

  R-Davison98Thesis ={At NASA, \citet{Huber95icra} implemented a
                  behaviour-based active vision approach which enab1ed
                  a robot to track and follow a moving target (usually
                  a person). Correllation-based tracking was triggered
                  after a period of active searching for movement, and
                  extra vision modules helped the tracking to be
                  stable. The system was not truly an active vision
                  navigation system however since sonar sensors were
                  used for obstac1e detection and path phnning.},

@article{Huebner07ar,
  Abstract =	 {Most recent robotic systems, capable of exploring
                  unknown environments, use topological structures
                  (graphs) as a spatial representation. Localization
                  can be done by deriving an estimate of the global
                  pose from landmark information. In this case
                  navigation is tightly coupled to metric knowledge,
                  and hence the derived control method is mainly
                  pose-based. Alternative to continuous metric
                  localization, it is also possible to base
                  localization methods on weaker constraints, e.g. the
                  similarity between images capturing the appearance
                  of places or landmarks. In this case navigation can
                  be controlled by a homing algorithm. Similarity
                  based localization can be scaled to continuous
                  metric localization by adding additional
                  constraints, such as alignment of depth
                  estimates. We present a method to scale a similarity
                  based navigation system (the view-graph-model) to
                  continuous metric localization. Instead of changing
                  the landmark model, we embed the graph into the
                  three dimensional pose space. Therefore,
                  recalibration of the path integrator is only
                  possible at discrete locations in the
                  environment. The navigation behavior of the robot is
                  controlled by a homing algorithm which combines
                  three local navigation capabilities, obstacle
                  avoidance, path integration, and scene based
                  homing. This homing scheme allows automated
                  adaptation to the environment. It is further used to
                  compensate for path integration errors, and
                  therefore allows to derive globally consistent pose
                  estimates based on ?eak?metric knowledge,
                  i.e. knowledge solely derived from odometry. The
                  system performance is tested with a robotic setup
                  and with a simulated agent which explores a large,
                  open, and cluttered environment.},

                  moves along the lines indicated by the 1$^{st}$
                  IARP/IEEE-RAS Workshop on Technical Challenge for
                  Dependable Robots in Human Environments
                  \cite{iarp01}, is about ``charting'' the new
                  ``territory'' of physical Human-Robot Interaction
                  (pHRI). To ensure these goals, the integration
                  competences in control, robotics, design and
                  realization of mechanical systems, human-machine
                  interaction, and in safety-dependability of
                  mechatronic systems is required. The PHRIDOM
                  Consortium is composed of 5 partners from 3
                  different European countries. },

  Abstract =	 {Automatic self-calibration of ad-hoc sensor networks
                  is a critical need for their use in military or
                  civilian applications. In general, self-calibration
                  involves the combination of absolute location
                  information (e.g. GPS) with relative calibration
                  information (e.g. time delay or received signal
                  strength between sensors) over regions of the
                  network. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to
                  distribute the computational burden across the
                  network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor
                  communication. We demonstrate that the information
                  used for sensor calibration is fundamentally local
                  with regard to the network topology and use this
                  observation to reformulate the problem within a
                  graphical model framework. We then demonstrate the
                  utility of nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), a
                  recent generalization of particle filtering, for
                  both estimating sensor locations and representing
                  location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage that
                  it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion,
                  admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can
                  represent multi-modal uncertainty. We illustrate the
                  performance of NBP on several example networks while
                  comparing to a previously published nonlinear least
                  squares method.},

  Abstract =	 {Advances in processor, memory and radio technology
                  will enable small and cheap nodes capable of
                  sensing, communication and computation. Networks of
                  such nodes can coordinate to perform distributed
                  sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper,
                  we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such
                  coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric in
                  that all communication is for named data. All nodes
                  in a directed diffusion-based network are
                  application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve
                  energy savings by selecting empirically good paths
                  and by caching and processing data in-network. We
                  explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion
                  for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.},

@article{Iyengar03imm,
  Abstract =	 {This article discusses about the developing
                  paradigms of data for sensor-actuator networks that
                  perform engineering tasks. We provide a new
                  foundation for data fusion based on two concepts: a
                  conceptual framework and the goal-seeking
                  paradigm. The conceptual framework emphasizes the
                  dominant structures in the system. The goal-seeking
                  paradigm is a mechanism for representing system
                  evolution that explicitly manages uncertainty. The
                  goal-seeking formulation for data fusion helps to
                  distinguish between subjective decisions that can be
                  executed by computers. These notions are useful for
                  critical tasks, such as security management in
                  large-scale distributed systems. Investigations in
                  this area, and further refinement of the
                  goal-seeking formulation for instrumentation and
                  measurement applications, are likely to future
                  systems that facilitate holistic user decision
                  making.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a background subtraction method that uses
                  multiple cues to robustly detect objects in adverse
                  conditions. The algorithm consists of three distinct
                  levels i.e pixel level, region level and frame
                  level. At the pixel level, statistical models of
                  gradients and color are separately used to classify
                  each pixel as belonging to background or
                  foreground. In region level, foreground pixels
                  obtained from the color based subtraction are
                  grouped into regions and gradient based sub-
                  traction is then used to make inferences about the
                  validity of these regions. Pixel based models are
                  updated based on decisions made at the region
                  level. Finally frame level analysis is performed to
                  detect global illumination changes. Our method
                  provides the solution to some of the common prob-
                  lems that are not addressed by most background
                  subtraction algorithms such as quick illumination
                  changes, repositioning of static background objects,
                  and initialization of background model with moving

  Abstract =	 {This paper deals with the problem of recovering the
                  dimensions of an object and its pose from a single
                  image acquired with a camera of unknown focal
                  length. It is assumed that the object in question
                  can be modeled as a polyhedron where the coordinates
                  of the vertices can be expressed as a linear
                  function of a dimension vector. The reconstruction
                  program takes as input, a set of correspondences
                  between features in the model and features in the
                  image. From this information, the program determines
                  an appropriate projection model for the camera, the
                  dimensions of the object, its pose relative to the
                  camera and, in the case of perspective projection,
                  the focal length of the camera. This paper describes
                  how the reconstruction problem can be framed as an
                  optimization over a compact set with low dimension
                  (no more than four). This optimization problem can
                  be solved efficiently by coupling standard nonlinear
                  optimization techniques with a multistart
                  method. The result is an efficient, reliable
                  solution system that does not require initial
                  estimates for any of the parameters being estimated},

  Abstract =	 {We present a system that consists of one camera
                  connected to a personal computer that can (a) select
                  and track a number of high-contrast point features
                  on a sequence of images, (b) estimate their
                  three-dimensional motion and position relative to an
                  inertial reference frame, assuming rigidity, (c)
                  handle occlusions that cause point-features to
                  disappear as well as new features to appear. The
                  system can also (d) perform partial self-calibration
                  and (e) check for consistency of the rigidity
                  assumption, although these features are not
                  implemented in the current release. All of this is
                  done automatically and in real-time (30 Hz) for
                  40-50 point features using commercial off-the-shelf
                  hardware. The system is based on an algorithm
                  presented by Chiuso et al. (2000), the properties of
                  which have been analyzed by Chiuso and Soatto
                  (2000). In particular, the algorithm is provably
                  observable, provably minimal and provably stable-
                  under suitable conditions. The core of the system,
                  consisting of C++ code ready to interface with a
                  frame grabber as well as Matlab code for
                  development, is available at
                  http://ee.wustl.edu/-soatto/research.html. We
                  demonstrate the system by showing its use as (1) an
                  ego-motion estimator, (2) an object tracker, and (3)
                  an interactive input device, all without any

  Abstract =	 {In general, multiple views are required to create a
                  complete 3-D model of an object or of a multi-roomed
                  indoor scene. In this work, we address the problem
                  of merging multiple textured 3-D data sets, each of
                  which corresponds to a different view of a scene or
                  object. There are two steps to the merging process:
                  registration and integration. To register, or align,
                  data sets we use a modified version of the Iterative
                  Closest Point algorithm; our version, which we call
                  color ICP, considers not only 3-D information, but
                  color as well. We show that the use of color
                  decreases registration error by an order of
                  magnitude. Once the 3-D data sets have been
                  registered we integrate them to produce a seamless,
                  composite 3-D textured model. Our approach to
                  integration uses a 3-D occupancy grid to represent
                  likelihood of spatial occupancy through voting. In
                  addition to occupancy information, we store surface
                  normal in each voxel of the occupancy grid. Surface
                  normal is used to robustly extract a surface from
                  the occupancy grid; on that surface we blend
                  textures from multiple views},

                  as multiple classes of Gaussian mean images where
                  only one class is allowed per step. Then, there are
                  hidden variables in the model which capture the
                  translation/shifts of the mean images within each
                  frame. In their model, the possible motions :
                  translations are pre-defined as unknown discrete
                  variables where each variable cause permutation
                  matrix to re-order the columns and rows of the image

                  fg masks, and bg which are pixelwisely
                  modeled. Multiple layers/bg modeling were not
                  addressed in Jojic00cvpr. The model is layered model
                  in that it assumes that the image is generated by
                  overlapping the bg image with the fg'son top of one
                  another with appropriate translations. The possible
                  tranlations (motions) are predefined as discrete
                  variables as in their Jojic00cvpr work. The authors
                  then solve the learning problem which involves the
                  learning of fgs/bg model+masks and motions in each
                  image through variational-EM in the maximum
                  likelihood frameowrkbecause the problem got coupled
                  severely between variables and exact EM is not
                  feasible anymore. Unlike their HMM work in
                  Jojic00cvpr, they do not have put frame ordering
                  constraints in their model and allow all the
                  translations to be equally likely. This would
                  suggest that a clever way of using such dynamic
                  constraints which is partly studied in Jojic00cvpr
                  by using HMMs as a way to have motion model can
                  improve the learning results. It is my impression
                  that this is very hard to solve the problems with
                  dynamic constraints in case of multiple layers. That
                  would be the reason why Jojic and Frey are using a
                  static model that does not consider the video
                  ordering for this work. They successfully learn the
                  fgs/bg model from the unordered images, and show fg
                  subtraction, removal of a second fg selectively from
                  the video, person appearance enhancements. One main
                  advantage of their works would be the use of mask
                  which seems to be rather unintuitive, but can
                  capture the non-rigid appearance of arbitrary
                  objects},

@article{Jones11ijrr,
  Abstract =	 {We describe a model to estimate motion from
                  monocular visual and inertial measurements. We
                  analyze the model and characterize the conditions
                  under which its state is observable, and its
                  parameters are identifiable. These include the
                  unknown gravity vector, and the unknown
                  transformation between the camera coordinate frame
                  and the inertial unit. We show that it is possible
                  to estimate both state and parameters as part of an
                  on-line procedure, but only provided that the motion
                  sequence is `rich enough', a condition that we
                  characterize explicitly. We then describe an
                  efficient implementation of a filter to estimate the
                  state and parameters of this model, including
                  gravity and camera-to-inertial calibration. It runs
                  in real-time on an embedded platform. We report
                  experiments of continuous operation, without
                  failures, re-initialization, or re-calibration, on
                  paths of length up to 30 km. We also describe an
                  integrated approach to loop-closure', that is the
                  recognition of previously seen locations and the
                  topological re-adjustment of the traveled path. It
                  represents visual features relative to the global
                  orientation reference provided by the gravity vector
                  estimated by the filter, and relative to the scale
                  provided by their known position within the map;
                  these features are organized into `locations'
                  defined by visibility constraints, represented in a
                  topological graph, where loop-closure can be
                  performed without the need to re-compute past
                  trajectories or perform bundle adjustment. The
                  software infrastructure as well as the embedded
                  platform is described in detail in a previous
                  technical report.},

                  a stationary vehicle (with no process noise) which
                  uses a range-bearing sensor and has non-zero angular
                  uncertainty, the full-covariance SLAM algorithm
                  always yields an inconsistent map. We also show,
                  through simulations, that these conclusions appear
                  to extend to a moving vehicle with process
                  noise. However, these inconsistencies only become

                  has received much attention over the last

                  the robot trajectory loops back on itself, are a
                  challenge. In this paper we introduce a new solution
                  to this problem of closing the loop. Our algorithm
                  is EM-based, but differs from previous work. The key
                  is a probability distribution over partitions of
                  feature tracks that is determined in the E-step,
                  based on the current estimate of the motion. This
                  virtual structure is then used in the M-step to
                  obtain a better estimate for the motion. We

  Abstract =	 {Camera-based simultaneous localization and mapping
                  or visual SLAM has received much attention
                  recently. Typically single cameras, multiple cameras
                  in a stereo setup or omni-directional cameras are
                  used. We propose a different approach, where
                  multiple cameras can be mounted on a robot in an
                  arbitrary configuration. Allowing the cameras to
                  face in different directions yields better
                  constraints than single cameras or stereo setups can
                  provide, simplifying the reconstruction of
                  large-scale environments. And in contrast to
                  omni-directional sensors, the available resolution
                  can be focused on areas of interest depending on the
                  application. We describe a sparse SLAM approach that

                  real-time application in large-scale

                  approximations, exploiting the natural sparsity of
                  the smoothing information matrix. A QR-factorization

                  real-time applications in large-scale
                  environments. The main advantages over filter-based
                  algorithms are that we solve the full SLAM problem
                  without the need for any approximations, and that we
                  do not suffer from linearization errors. We achieve
                  efficiency by updating the square-root information
                  matrix, a factored version of the naturally sparse
                  smoothing information matrix. We can efficiently

  Abstract =	 {Data association is one of the core problems of
                  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and it
                  requires knowledge about the uncertainties of the
                  estimation problem in the form of marginal
                  covariances. However, it is often difficult to
                  access these quantities without calculating the full
                  and dense covariance matrix, which is prohibitively
                  expensive.  We present a dynamic programming
                  algorithm for efficient recovery of the marginal
                  covariances needed for data association. As input we
                  use a square root information matrix as maintained
                  by our incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM)
                  algorithm.  The contributions beyond our previous
                  work are an improved algorithm for recovering the
                  marginal covariances and a more thorough treatment
                  of data association now including the joint
                  compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) algorithm. We
                  further show how to make information theoretic
                  decisions about measurements before actually taking
                  the measurement, therefore allowing a reduction in
                  estimation complexity by omitting uninformative
                  measurements. We evaluate our work on simulated and

  Abstract =	 {We present iSAM2, a fully incremental, graph-based
                  version of incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM).
                  iSAM2 is based on a novel graphical model-based
                  interpretation of incremental sparse matrix
                  factorization methods, afforded by the recently
                  introduced Bayes tree data structure. The original
                  iSAM algorithm incrementally maintains the square
                  root information matrix by applying matrix
                  factorization updates.  We analyze the matrix
                  updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes
                  tree and the conditional densities represented by
                  its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a
                  method to incrementally change the variable ordering
                  which has a large effect on efficiency. We also
                  introduce fluid relinearization, the concept of
                  selectively relinearizing variables as needed, to
                  obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any
                  need for periodic batch steps.We analyze the
                  properties of the resulting algorithm in detail, and
                  show on various real and simulated datasets that the
                  iSAM2 algorithm compares favorably with other recent
                  mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

@article{Kaess12ijrr,
  Abstract =	 {We present a novel data structure, the Bayes tree,
                  that provides an algorithmic foundation enabling a
                  better understanding of existing graphical model
                  inference algorithms and their connection to sparse
                  matrix factorization methods. Similar to a clique
                  tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability
                  density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed
                  and maps more naturally to the square root
                  information matrix of the simultaneous localization
                  and mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, we
                  highlight three insights provided by our new data
                  structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better
                  understanding of the matrix factorization in terms
                  of probability densities. Second, we show how the
                  fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization
                  translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and
                  its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes
                  tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for
                  sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named
                  iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency
                  through incremental variable re-ordering and fluid
                  relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic
                  batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2
                  in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated
                  datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with
                  other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and
                  efficiency.},

                  (SLAM). The algorithm is vision- and odometry-based,
                  and enables lowcost navigation in cluttered and
                  populated environments. No initial map is required,
                  and it satisfactorily handles dynamic changes in the
                  environment, for example, lighting changes, moving
                  objects and/or people. Typically, vSLAM recovers
                  quickly from dramatic disturbances, such as
                  "kidnapping".},

                  effectively by a tree-processing algorithm, has been
                  discovered and rediscovered in different
                  contexts. ... The aim of this paper is to present
                  the central concepts and properties of cluster-tree
                  decomposition techniques by way of a single, unified
                  framework for the purpose of making it more

                  facilitating the transfer of this methodology among
                  these areas. Specifically, we demonstrate that
                  join-tree clustering, junction-tree decomposition,
                  and hyper-tree decomposition that, as mentioned
                  above, were developed in different contexts and for
                  different applications, are all instances of our
                  unified scheme. Also, as we show, variable
                  elimination algorithms can be viewed as processing
                  specific cluster-tree decompositions. ... Our work
                  expands on \cite{Shafer90uai} in several
                  ways. First, we use a graph-based language,
                  connecting our approach explicitly to graphical
                  models and using graph-based parameters for
                  capturing algorithmic principles. In particular, we
                  provide graph-based complexity analysis that focuses
                  on the time vs. space issue. Second, we emphasize
                  the distinction between the generation of a
                  structural tree-decomposition and the
                  tree-processing algorithms that are enabled by the
                  decomposition. Third, we show that variable
                  elimination algorithms can be viewed as a specific
                  tree-processing schemes that can be generalized to
                  full processing along special tree-decompositions
                  called bucket trees. Finally, we note how different
                  tree-decompositions of a given problem yield a
                  spectrum of time-space complexity characteristics
                  using superbuckets. ... Join-trees correspond to
                  minimal tree-decompositions. This restriction
                  exclude the super-bucket methods that accommodates
                  time-space trade-offs. ... We present these classes
                  of algorithms by harnessing the formal notation
                  appearing in \cite{Gottlob00ai} (which is restricted
                  there to constraint satisfaction). This allows
                  separating tree-structuring from tree-processing.},

                  robotics research. The multiple robot systems
                  require robust methods to identify robots for

                  method using omnidirectional vision sensors for the
                  identification between the robots. In addition to

                  1996). In particular there is the hope that advances
                  in the state of the art of propositional reasoning
                  systems carry directly over to planning systems
                  relying on this terminology. In fact, Kautz and
                  Selman (1999) predicted that research on planning
                  methods will become superfluous because the state of
                  the art in propositional reasoning systems will
                  advance much faster than in planning systems.},

                  egocentric in nature" ... "However, it is now
                  recognized that the structure of the scene itself
                  plays a critical role in reference frame selection,
                  and that the reference frames selected through

                  environmental structure does not provide a stronger
                  reference frame." "Environmental structures, such as
                  the rectangular walls of a room (Hintzman, O�Dell, &
                  Arndt, 1981; Shelton & McNamara, 2001), the

                  salient environmental reference frames used to
                  structure spatial memories. Shelton and McNamara
                  (2001) proposed that reference frames are chosen on
                  the basis of a combination of egocentric experience"

                  have qualified this theory by showing that even

                  the appropriate conditions (Mou and McNamara, 2002)"

  Abstract =	 {An inductive inference problem will often be
                  structured so that the target variable (hypotheses)
                  are logically distant from the observable events
                  (data). In this situation it may be difficult or
                  impossible to assess the probabilistic connection
                  between them, but it may be possible to decompose
                  the problem through the use of intermediate or
                  explanatory variables. That is, it will often be
                  possible to assess the likelihood of the observed
                  data given some intermediate variable, and the
                  likelihood of that intermediate variable given
                  another, and so on, until the hypotheses of interest
                  are reached. Inferences which incorporate one or
                  more intermediate variables are called hierarchical,
                  cascaded, or multistage inferences. The present
                  paper presents a normative model for the solution of
                  the general hierarchical inference problem. The
                  formulation begins with a formal description of the
                  hierarchical inference tree, including a discussion
                  of various simplifying conditional independence
                  assumptions. The solution is first derived for three
                  special case models of differing structure, and then
                  the algorithm for the general solution is given for
                  two cases: one in which the conditional independence
                  assumptions have been made and one in which they
                  have not.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a real-time algorithm for
                  foreground-background segmentation. Sample
                  background values at each pixel are quantized into
                  codebooks which represent a compressed form of
                  background model for a long image sequence. This
                  allows us to capture structural background variation
                  due to periodic-like motion over a long period of
                  time under limited memory. The codebook
                  representation is efficient in memory and speed
                  compared with other background modeling
                  techniques. Our method can handle scenes containing
                  moving backgrounds or illumination variations, and
                  it achieves robust detection for different types of
                  videos. We compared our method with other multimode
                  modeling techniques. In addition to the basic
                  algorithm, two features improving the algorithm are
                  presented-layered modeling/detection and adaptive
                  codebook updating. For performance evaluation, we
                  have applied perturbation detection rate analysis to

  Abstract =	 {Multi-view stereo methods frequently fail to
                  properly reconstruct 3D scene geometry if visible
                  texture is sparse or the scene exhibits difficult
                  self-occlusions. Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth sensors
                  can provide 3D information regardless of texture but
                  with only limited resolution and accuracy. To find
                  an optimal reconstruction, we propose an integrated
                  multi-view sensor fusion approach that combines
                  information from multiple color cameras and multiple
                  ToF depth sensors. First, multi-view ToF sensor
                  measurements are combined to obtain a coarse but
                  complete model. Then, the initial model is refined
                  by means of a probabilistic multi-view fusion
                  framework, optimizing over an energy function that
                  aggregates ToF depth sensor information with
                  multi-view stereo and silhouette constraints. We
                  obtain high quality dense and detailed 3D models of
                  scenes challenging for stereo alone, while
                  simultaneously reducing complex noise of ToF
                  sensors.},

  Abstract =	 {The basis of visually guided locomotion is the
                  ambient optical flow. Because animals with frontal
                  eyes can sample only a portion of the flow field,
                  they must continuously scan in order to be aware of
                  their surroundings. Such scanning introduces
                  additional transformations of the retinal image,
                  apparently complicating the extraction from retinal
                  flow of the information in optical flow. In this
                  study, the authors conducted computer simulations of
                  eye movement graphically. These simulations revealed
                  that when gaze direction coincides with heading
                  direction on curvilinear paths, velocity vectors in
                  the image plane become linearized. The active
                  rotation of the eyes is, in effect, an essential
                  mechanism for extracting the self-movement
                  information contained in optical flow from flow
                  patterns on the retinas. Strategically positioning
                  the eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear and,
                  thereby, converts a complicated information pickup
                  problem into a considerably simpler problem. Based
                  on these simulations, the authors contend that
                  heading direction is specified by the
                  perpendicularly aligned vectors.},

                  simulation of the retinal flow when the eyes are
                  directed at a point lying on the locomotory
                  path. For this field of view, all the image
                  trajectories are linearized. The vector directions
                  in Figure 3e are the same over successive
                  frames. Each velocity vector [] lies in the
                  direction tangent to the corresponding flow line
                  (i.e., the trajectory that a surface element
                  traces). Curves formed by connecting the velocity
                  vectors with the same direction define streamlines
                  of a flow field (Sutton, 1957). .. In contrast to
                  the complexities suggested by the preceding remarks,
                  there seems to be a simple rule for identifying the
                  path of locomotion regardless of its nature, that
                  is, linear or circular: Move the eyes until the
                  image trajectories on the retina are rendered
                  linear; then you are looking in the direction in
                  which you are heading, and the trajectory defined by
                  the perpendicular image vectors is your path of
                  locomotion. .. To conclude, why do we rotate the
                  eyes if, as often argued, rotation serves only to
                  induce ambiguity? Based on the arguments presented
                  here, the active rotation of the eyes is, in effect,
                  an essential mechanism for extracting the
                  self-movement information contained in optical flow
                  from flow patterns on the retinas. Strategically
                  positioning the eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear
                  and, thereby, converts a complicated information
                  pickup problem into a considerably simpler problem.},

  Abstract =	 {The ability to localise a camera moving in a
                  previously unknown environment is desirable for a
                  wide range of applications. In computer vision this
                  problem is studied as monocular SLAM. Recent years
                  have seen improvements to the usability and
                  scalability of monocular SLAMsystems to the point
                  that they may soon find uses outside of laboratory
                  conditions. However, the robustness of these systems
                  to rapid camera motions (we refer to this quality as
                  agility) still lags behind that of tracking systems
                  which use known object models. In this paper we
                  attempt to remedy this. We present two approaches to
                  improving the agility of a keyframe-based SLAM
                  system: Firstly, we add edge features to the map and
                  exploit their resilience to motion blur to improve
                  tracking under fast motion. Secondly, we implement a
                  very simple inter-frame rotation estimator to aid
                  tracking when the camera is rapidly panning � and
                  demonstrate that this method also enables a
                  trivially simple yet effective relocalisation
                  method. Results show that a SLAM system combining
                  points, edge features and motion initialisation
                  allows highly agile tracking at a moderate increase
                  in processing time.  },

                  solution is exact and gives the same result as

  Abstract =	 {This study addresses the question of how simple
                  networks can account for a variety of phenomena
                  associated with the shift of a specialized
                  processing focus across the visual scene. We address
                  in particular aspects of the dichotomy between the
                  preattentive-parallel and the attentive-serial modes
                  of visual perception and their hypothetical neuronal
                  implementations. Specifically, we propose the
                  following: (1) A number of elementary features, such
                  as color, orientation, direction of movement,
                  disparity etc. are represented in parallel in
                  different topographical maps, called the early
                  representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping
                  from this early representation into a more central
                  representation, such that at any instant the central
                  representation contains the properties of only a
                  single location in the visual scene, the {\it
                  selected} location. (3) We discuss some selection
                  rules that determine which location will be mapped
                  into the central representation. The major rule,
                  using the saliency or conspicuity of locations in
                  the early representation, is implemented using a
                  so-called Winner-Take-All network. A hierarchical
                  pyramid--like architecture is proposed for this
                  network. We suggest possible implementations in
                  neuronal hardware, including a possible role for the
                  extensive back-projection form the cortex to the
                  LGN.},

  Abstract =	 { Automatic symbolic traffic scene analysis is essen-
                  tial to many areas of IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle
                  High- way Systems). Traffic scene information can be
                  used to optimize traffic flow during busy periods,
                  identify stalled vehicles and accidents, and aid the
                  decision- making of an autonomous vehicle
                  controller. Improve- ments in technologies for
                  machine vision-based surveil- lance and high-level
                  symbolic reasoning have enabled us to develop a
                  system for detailed, reliable traffic scene
                  analysis. The machine vision component of our system
                  employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model
                  based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle
                  trajectories over a sequence of traffic scene
                  images. The symbolic reasoning component uses a
                  dynamic belief network to make inferences about
                  traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and
                  stalls. In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of
                  the vision and reasoning components as well as their
                  integration into a working prototype. Prelim- inary
                  results of an implementation on special purpose
                  hardware using C-40 Digital Signal Processors show
                  that near real-time performance can be achieved
                  with- out further improvements.},

                  misconception that the line between poly- trees and
                  other networks was a sharp cutoff, so that only
                  inference in polytrees was tractable. ... Thus, if
                  we find a chordal graph that contains the moralized
                  graph , we can use it as the basis for inference on
                  . The process of turning a graph into a chordal
                  graph is also called
                  triangulation. ... Historically, largely due to the
                  initial popularity of the polytree algorithm, the
                  conditioning approach has been mostly used in the
                  case where the transformed network is a
                  polytree. ... one might wonder why anyone bothers
                  with the con- ditioning algorithm. There are two
                  main reasons. First, variable elimination gains its
                  computational savings from caching factors computed
                  as intermediate results. The second reason for using
                  conditioning is that it forms the basis for a useful
                  approximate inference algorithm.},

                  as well as an on-line, distributed algorithm that
                  builds maps. The algorithms depend on the additive
                  property of constraints in the Lu-Milios mapping
                  technique. We show the results of large-scale
                  (>100m2) indoor maps built using information from a
                  set of mapping robots.},

                  Estimation (CPE) algorithms can successfully map
                  areas of 104 square meters, using thousands of
                  poses. However, the computation to construct the map
                  grows as O(n log n), so larger maps get increasingly
                  difficult to build. We present an abstraction method
                  for postponing the growth in computation.  This
                  method solves a much smaller problem in the space of

                  matching visual frames with large numbers of point
                  features. The relationship between frames is kept as
                  a nonlinear measurement, and can be used to solve
                  large loop closures quickly. Both monocular
                  (bearing-only) and binocular vision can be used to
                  generate matches. Other advantages of our system are
                  that no special landmark initialization is required,

  Abstract =	 {Motion estimation from imagery, sometimes called
                  visual odometry, is a well-known process. However,
                  it is difficult to achieve good performance using
                  standard techniques. In this paper, we present the
                  results of several years of work on an integrated
                  system to localize a mobile robot in rough outdoor
                  terrain using visual odometry, with an increasing
                  degree of precision. We discuss issues that are
                  important for realtime, high-precision performance:
                  choice of features, matching strategies, incremental
                  bundle adjustment, and filtering with inertial
                  measurement sensors. Using data with ground truth
                  from an RTK GPS system, we show experimentally that

                  rendering as well as robotic navigation and

                  approach for automatic extraction of dominant
                  rectangular structures from a single view and show
                  how they facilitate the recovery of camera pose,
                  planar structure and matching across widely
                  separated views. In the presented approach the
                  rectangular hypothesis formation is based on a
                  higher level information encoded by the presence of
                  orthogonal vanishing directions, the dominant
                  rectangular structures can be detected and matched

  Abstract =	 {The computational complexity of SLAM is dominated by
                  the cost of factorizing a matrix derived from the
                  measurements into a square root form, which has
                  cubic complexity in the worst case. However, the
                  matrices associated with the full SLAM problem are
                  typically very sparse, as opposed to the dense
                  problems one obtains in a filtering context. Hence
                  much faster, sparse factorization algorithms can be
                  used. Furthermore, the cost can be further reduced
                  by choosing a good order in which to eliminate
                  variables during the factorization process, leading
                  to more or less fill-in. In particular, in this
                  paper we investigate how a nested dissection
                  ordering method can provably improve the performance
                  of the full SLAM algorithm. We show that the
                  computational complexity for the factorization of a
                  large class of measurement matrices occurring in the
                  SLAM problem can be tightly bound under reasonable
                  assumptions.},

  C-Kaess =	 {This paper analyzes the complexity of planar SLAM
                  based on nested dissection. A quick comparison for
                  planar SLAM examples shows only a marginal advantage
                  of AMD ordering over nested dissection, but the
                  latter is easier to analyze. Based on existing
                  theorems, it is shown that planar SLAM with nested
                  dissection has fill-in O(n log n) and time
                  complexity O(n^1.5), but with potentially large
                  constant factors. While SLAM graphs even in planar
                  environments are not exactly planar, they can be
                  "compressed" (graph theory) into a meta graph that
                  is exactly planar. An urban map serves as
                  example. Special cases with linear complexity are
                  environments of bounded size (first eliminate all
                  poses - Schur complement trick), exploration without
                  loop closure, and fixed sensor networks (first
                  eliminate all structure).},

  Abstract =	 {A new taxonomy is proposed that relates different
                  navigational behaviors in a hierarchical and
                  compositional way. Elementary navigation tactics are
                  combined to tactical navigation in routes; landmarks
                  in space are contrasted to routemarks in networks of
                  passages. Survey knowledge comes in at the level of
                  strategic navigation. The Bremen Autonomous
                  Wheelchair is then presented as a vehicle for
                  experimentation in robotics, both to model
                  biologically plausible navigational behaviors and to
                  develop efficient navigational mechanisms for a
                  technical application. The implementation on the
                  autonomous system is based on the use of basic
                  behaviors and the identification of routemarks. The
                  actual recognition of artificial routemarks is
                  described and early results of the current work on
                  the identification of natural 3-D marks are

  Abstract =	 {Algorithms that must deal with complicated global
                  functions of many variables often exploit the manner
                  in which the given functions factor as a product of
                  `local' functions, each of which depends on a subset
                  of the variables. Such a factorization can be
                  visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a
                  factor graph. In this tutorial paper, we present a
                  generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product
                  algorithm, that operates in a factor
                  graph. Following a single, simple computational
                  rule, the sum-product algorithm computes---either
                  exactly or approximately---various marginal
                  functions derived from the global function. A wide
                  variety of algorithms developed in artificial
                  intelligence, signal processing, and digital
                  communications can be derived as specific instances
                  of the sum-product algorithm, including the
                  forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm,
                  the iterative `turbo' decoding algorithm, Pearl's

  Abstract =	 {Many popular problems in robotics and computer
                  vision including various types of simultaneous
                  localization and mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment
                  (BA) can be phrased as least squares optimization of
                  an error function that can be represented by a
                  graph. This paper describes the general structure of
                  such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++
                  framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error
                  functions.  Our system has been designed to be
                  easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a
                  new problem typically can be specified in a few
                  lines of code.  The current implementation provides
                  solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA. We
                  provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world
                  and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that
                  while being general g2o offers a performance
                  comparable to implementations of state-of-the-art

  Abstract =	 {The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy is a model of
                  knowledge of large-scale space consisting of
                  multiple interacting representations, both
                  qualitative and quantitative. The SSH is inspired by
                  the properties of the human cognitive map, and is
                  intended to serve both as a model of the human
                  cognitive map and as a method for robot exploration
                  and map-building. The multiple levels of the SSH
                  express states of partial knowledge, and thus enable
                  the human or robotic agent to deal robustly with
                  uncertainty during both learning and
                  problem-solving. The control level represents useful
                  patterns of sensorimotor interaction with the world
                  in the form of trajectory-following and
                  hill-climbing control laws leading to locally
                  distinctive states. Local geometric maps in local
                  frames of reference can be constructed at the
                  control level to serve as observers for control laws
                  in particular neighborhoods. The causal level
                  abstracts continuous behavior among distinctive
                  states into a discrete model consisting of states
                  linked by actions. The topological level introduces
                  the external ontology of places, paths and regions
                  by abduction, to explain the observed pattern of
                  states and actions at the causal level. Quantitative
                  knowledge at the control, causal and topological
                  levels supports a ?atchworkmap?of local geometric
                  frames of reference linked by causal and topological
                  connections. The patchwork map can be merged into a
                  single global frame of reference at the metrical
                  level when sufficient information and computational
                  resources are available. We describe the assumptions
                  and guarantees behind the generality of the SSH
                  across environments and sensorimotor
                  systems. Evidence is presented from several partial

                  Hierarchy that combines their strengths and avoids
                  their weaknesses. Metrical SLAM methods are used to
                  build local maps of small-scale space within the
                  sensory horizon of the agent, while topological

                  structure is within the sensory horizon. Small-scale
                  space is described by a local perceptual map that is
                  metrically accurate and is constructed directly from
                  sensory input. Recently developed SLAM methods are
                  well suited for creating such a local
                  perceptualmap.We avoid the problem of closing large
                  loops by confining the map to the agent? local
                  perceptual surround, where we can apply the
                  strengths of existing SLAM methods. When reasoning
                  about small-scale space, we are concerned only with
                  the frame of reference of the local perceptual map,
                  and not with its inevitable drift with respect to
                  the world frame of reference. We call the resulting
                  combined model of large-scale and small-scale space,
                  the hybrid SSH.},

  Abstract =	 {This dissertation presents a model of the knowledge
                  a person has about the spatial structure of a
                  large-scale environment: the ``cognitive map.'' The
                  functions of the cognitive map are to assimilate new
                  information about the environment, to represent the
                  current position, and to answer route-finding and
                  relative-position problems. This model (called the
                  TOUR model) analyzes the cognitive map in terms of
                  symbolic descriptions of the environment and
                  operations on those descriptions. Knowledge about a
                  particular environment is represented in terms of
                  route descriptions, a topological network of paths
                  and places, multiple frames of reference for
                  relative positions, dividing boundaries, and a
                  structure of containing regions. The current
                  position is described by the ``You Are Here''
                  pointer, which acts as a working memory and a focus
                  of attention. Operations on the cognitive map are
                  performed by inference rules which act to transfer
                  information among different descriptions and the
                  ``You Are Here'' pointer. The TOUR model shows how
                  the particular descriptions chosen to represent
                  spatial knowledge support assimilation of new
                  information from local observations into the
                  cognitive map, and how the cognitive map solves
                  route-finding and relative-position problems. A
                  central theme of this research is that the states of
                  partial knowledge supported by a representation are
                  responsible for its ability to function with limited
                  information or computational resources. The
                  representations in the TOUR model provide a rich
                  collection of states of partial knowledge, and
                  therefore exhibit flexible, ``common-sense''
                  behavior. },

                  to this investigation, and an inference strategy by
                  which these sensory events are assimilated into
                  descriptions of spatial structure. We also discuss

  Abstract =	 {The "Map in the Head" metaphor states that knowledge
                  of large-scale space is isomorphic to the
                  information stored in a graphical map: That is,
                  corresponding operations are used to store and
                  retrieve information. The purpose of this essay is
                  to look carefully at the "Map in the Head" metaphor
                  to see the limits of its applicability. There are
                  two types of experimental results that are difficult
                  to accommodate within this metaphor. First, instead
                  of being integrated into a single map, spatial
                  knowledge can fall into disconnected components,
                  with little or no relation between the
                  components. Second, knowledge of routes (and other
                  spatial facts) may be represented asymmetrically, so
                  that a route can be followed in one direction but
                  not in the other. The first set of results leads us
                  to replace the simple "Map in the Head" with a more
                  complex and sophisticated metaphor including
                  separate metrical and topological components. The
                  second set of results suggests that even the more
                  sophisticated "Map in the Head" is built from
                  computational structures that occasionally reveal
                  their nonmaplike properties. A computational model
                  is presented for assimilating observations gathered
                  during travel, first into a description of the
                  particular route, then into representations for the
                  topological and metrical features of the
                  environment.},

  Abstract =	 {A number of positioning identification techniques
                  have been used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is
                  a popular method, but is not reliable when a robot
                  travels long distances or over an uneven surface
                  because of variations in wheel diameter and wheel
                  slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the
                  current position relative to landmarks, cannot be
                  used in an uncharted environment. The authors
                  propose a new method called ?�cooperative
                  positioning with multiple robots?? For cooperative
                  positioning, the authors divide the robots into two
                  groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains
                  stationary and acts as a landmark while group B
                  moves. The moving group B then stops and acts as a
                  landmark for group A. This ?�dance??is repeated
                  until the target robot position are
                  reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower
                  accumulated positioning error than dead reckoning,
                  and can work in three-dimensions which is not
                  possible with dead reckoning. Also, this method has
                  inherent landmarks and therefore works in uncharted
                  environments. This paper discusses the positioning
                  accuracy of the authors' method with error variances
                  for an example with three mobile robots},

                  camera mounted on the robot is used as the measuring
                  device and image quality is incorporated into data

                  path control strategy to maintain the accuracy of
                  the SLAM process is also illustrated. Experimental

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a multiple hypothesis approach
                  to solve the simultaneous localisation and mapping
                  (SLAM) problem with a bearing-only sensor. The main
                  contribution of the paper is to provide a remedy for
                  the landmark initialisation problem that occurs due
                  to the absence of range information, in a
                  computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is
                  initialised in the form of multiple hypotheses
                  distributed along the direction of the bearing
                  measurement. Using subsequent measurements, the
                  validity of the hypotheses is evaluated based on the
                  sequential probability ratio test
                  (SPRT). Consequently, the best approximation to the
                  landmark location is maintained. This approach
                  enables an extended Kalman filler (EKF) to be used
                  for bearing-only SLAM providing a computational
                  efficient solution. Simulation and experimental
                  results, from using a camera as the bearing-only
                  sensor mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

  Abstract =	 {Two recent studies have investigated the relations
                  of eye and hand movements in extended food
                  preparation tasks, and here the results are
                  compared. The tasks could be divided into a series
                  of actions performed on objects. The eyes usually
                  reached the next object in the sequence before any
                  sign of manipulative action, indicating that eye
                  movements are planned into the motor pattern and
                  lead each action. The eyes usually fixated the same
                  object throughout the action upon it, although they
                  often moved on to the next object in the sequence
                  before completion of the preceding action. The
                  specific roles of individual fixations could be
                  identified as locating (establishing the locations
                  of objects for future use), directing (establishing
                  target direction prior to contact), guiding
                  (supervising the relative movements of two or three
                  objects) and checking (establishing whether some
                  particular condition is met, prior to the
                  termination of an action). It is argued that, at the
                  beginning of each action, the oculomotor system is
                  supplied with the identity of the required object,
                  information about its location, and instructions
                  about the nature of the monitoring required during
                  the action. The eye movements during this kind of
                  task are nearly all to task-relevant objects, and
                  thus their control is seen as primarily ?op-down?
                  and influenced very little by the ?ntrinsic
                  salience?of objects.},

                  soon as another sense is available to take
                  over. .. Object localization is often a two-stage
                  process, with place memory being used to get the
                  eyes close enough for direct object detection. In

                  previously, a simple scanning strategy was also
                  invoked, but this was fairly uncommon. .. Our
                  studies lend no support to the idea that the visual
                  system builds up a detailed model of the
                  surroundings and operates from that. Most

  Abstract =	 {Large changes in the direction of gaze are made with
                  a combination of fast saccadic eye movements and
                  rather slower head movements. Since the first study
                  on freely moving subjects, most authors have agreed
                  that the head movement component of gaze is very
                  variable, with a high 'volitional' component. But in
                  some circumstances head and eye movements can be
                  quite predictable, for example when a subject is
                  asked to shift gaze as quickly as possible. Under
                  these conditions, laboratory studies have shown that
                  the eye and head motor-systems both receive
                  gaze-change commands, although they execute them in
                  rather different ways. Here I reconsider the way
                  gaze direction is changed during free movement, but
                  in the performance of a task where the subject is
                  too busy to exert conscious control over head or eye
                  movements. Using a new portable and inexpensive
                  method for recording head and eye movements, I
                  examine the oculomotor behaviour of car drivers,
                  particularly during the large gaze changes made at
                  road junctions. The results show that the pattern of
                  eye and head movements is highly preditable, given
                  only the sequence of gaze targets.},

  Abstract =	 {Steering a car requires visual information from the
                  changing pattern of the road ahead. There are many
                  theories about what features a driver might use, and
                  recent attempts to engineer self-steering vehicles
                  have sharpened interest in the mechanisms
                  involved. However, there is little direct
                  information linking steering performance to the
                  driver's direction of gaze. We have made
                  simultaneous recordings of steering-wheel angle and
                  drivers' gaze direction during a series of drives
                  along a tortuous road. We found that drivers rely
                  particularly on the 'tangent point' on the inside of
                  each curve, seeking this point 1? s before each bend
                  and returning to it throughout the bend. The
                  direction of this point relative to the car's
                  heading predicts the curvature of the road ahead,
                  and we examine the way this information is used.},

                  the tangent point on the inside of a curve, a
                  strategy similar to the one depicted in Figure
                  2c. The utility of this point appears to be
                  maximized at 1 sec into a bend (> 75\% of the time
                  is spent at fixating this point), after which it
                  degrades rapidly (only 50\% after 2 sec). Donges
                  (1978) suggesed that, for successful steering,
                  drivers need not only information about the
                  curvature of the desired path but information about
                  the vehicle's current position. In a laboratory
                  study based on Land and Lee, Land and Horwood (1995)
                  observed that the crucial portion of the road for
                  successful steering is not the distant part but a
                  portion about 4 to 60 below the horizon of the
                  road. Note that the distant part is where the
                  tangent point is clearly visible, whereas the
                  optimum portion lacks such a point. The results are
                  consistent with Gibson's (1966, 1979/1986) notion of
                  visual kinethesis, the information about the
                  movement of the observer with respect to the
                  environment, provided in optical flow. That is,
                  optical flow contains information about the
                  observer, which in tum is used to correct his or her
                  locomotion (i.e., not only the future path but
                  position in the road).},

@article{Land99jcp,
  Abstract =	 {Nearly all animals with good vision have a
                  repertoire of eye movements. The majority show a
                  pattern of stable fixations with fast saccades that
                  shift the direction of gaze. These movements may be
                  made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or in some
                  insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                  gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the
                  blur that results from the long response time of the
                  photoreceptors. Blur begins to degrade the image at
                  a retinal velocity of about 1 receptor acceptance
                  angle per response time. Some insects
                  (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                  rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested
                  that the need to see the motion of small objects
                  against a background imposes even more stringent
                  conditions on image motion. A third reason for
                  preventing rotational image motion is to prevent
                  contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                  which a moving animal can judge its heading and the
                  distances of objects. Some animals do let their eyes
                  rotate smoothly, and these include some heteropod
                  molluscs, mantis shrimps and jumping spiders, all of
                  which have narrow linear retinae which scan across
                  the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                  during orientation flights at speeds of
                  100?00?s. This is just consistent with a blur-free
                  image, as are the scanning speeds of the animals
                  with linear retinae.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper establishes a general framework for
                  Bayesian model-based clustering, in which subset
                  labels are exchangeable, and items are also
                  exchangeable, possibly up to covariate effects. It
                  is rich enough to encompass a variety of existing
                  procedures, including some recently discussed
                  methodologies involving stochastic search or
                  hierarchical clustering, but more importantly allows
                  the formulation of clustering procedures that are
                  optimal with respect to a specified loss
                  function. Our focus is on loss functions based on
                  pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of
                  items are clustered into the same subset or
                  not. Optimisation of the posterior expected loss
                  function can be formulated as a binary integer
                  programming problem, which can be readily solved,
                  for example by the simplex method, when clustering a
                  modest number of items, but quickly becomes
                  impractical as problem scale increases. To combat
                  this, a new heuristic item-swapping algorithm is
                  introduced. This performs well in our numerical
                  experiments, on both simulated and real data
                  examples. The paper includes a comparison of the
                  statistical performance of the (approximate) optimal
                  clustering with earlier methods that are model-based
                  but ad hoc in their detailed definition.},

  Abstract =	 {Adaptive Gaussian mixtures have been used for
                  modeling nonstationary temporal distributions of
                  pixels in video surveillance applications. However,
                  a common problem for this approach is balancing
                  between model convergence speed and stability. This
                  paper proposes an effective scheme to improve the
                  convergence rate without compromising model
                  stability. This is achieved by replacing the global,
                  static retention factor with an adaptive learning
                  rate calculated for each Gaussian at every
                  frame. Significant improvements are shown on both
                  synthetic and real video data. Incorporating this
                  algorithm into a statistical framework for
                  background subtraction leads to an improved
                  segmentation performance compared to a standard

  Abstract =	 {We present a new localization algorithm, called
                  sensor resetting localization, which is an extension
                  of Monte Carlo localization. The algorithm adds
                  sensor based re-sampling to Monte Carlo localization
                  when the robot is lost. Sensor resetting
                  localization (SRL) is robust to modelling errors
                  including unmodelled movements and systematic
                  errors. It can be used in real time on systems with
                  limited computational power. The algorithm has been
                  successfully used on autonomous legged robots in the
                  Sony legged league of the robotic soccer competition
                  RoboCup'99. We present results from the real robots
                  demonstrating the success of the algorithm and

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a new efcient algorithm for
                  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), using
                  multiple overlapping submaps, each built with
                  respect to a local frame of reference dened by one
                  of the features in the submap. The global position
                  of each submap is estimated using information from
                  other submaps in an efcient, provably consistent
                  manner. For situations where the mobile robot is
                  able to make repeated visits to all regions of the
                  environment, the method achieves convergence to a
                  near-optimal result with O(1) time complexity while
                  maintaining consistent error bounds. Simulation
                  results demonstrate the ability of the technique to

                  tracking sonars. The basic low-level competence is
                  the focus of attention. This is used to maintain
                  correspondence with individual environment features

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents an algorithm for autonomous map
                  building and maintenance for a mobile robot. We
                  believe that mobile robot navigation can be treated
                  as a problem of tracking geometric features which
                  occur naturally in the environment. We represent
                  each feature in the map by a location estimate (the
                  feature state vector) and two distinct measures of
                  uncertainty: a covariance matrix to represent
                  uncertainty in feature location, and a credibility
                  measure to represent our belief in the validity of
                  the feature. During each position update cycle,
                  predicted measurements are generated for each
                  geometric feature in the map and compared to actual
                  sensor observations. Successful matches cause a
                  feature's credibility to be increased. Unpredicted
                  observations are used to initialize new geometric
                  features, while unobserved predictions result in a
                  geometric feature's credibility being decreased. We
                  describe experimental results obtained with the
                  algorithm that demonstrate successful map building

  Quotes =	 {We have developed a multi-level theory of spatial
                  representation of the environment based upon the
                  observation and re-acquisition of distinctive visual
                  events, i.e., landmarks. The representation provides
                  the theoretical foundations for a visual memory
                  database that includes coordinate-free, topological
                  representation of relative spatial location, yet
                  smoothly integrates available metric knowledge of
                  relative or absolute angles and distances. .. A key
                  contribution of this work is the realization of true
                  local coordinate systems, and a theory that makes
                  them computationally useful to a sighted mobile
                  robot. Using visually-based local coordinate
                  systems, which we call viewframes, a robot can
                  navigate about its environment, determining its
                  relative location in the world with essentially a
                  constant error. In particular, there is no
                  multiplicative accumulation of error in
                  location. .. Furthermore, humans and animals perform
                  navigation and guidance tasks quite reliably with
                  extremely poor range estimates, and very coarse
                  angular information. .. the notion of a geographic
                  "place" is defined in terms of data about visible
                  landmarks. A place, as a point on the surface of the
                  ground, is defined by the landmarks and spatial
                  relationships between landmarks that can be observed
                  from a fixed location. More generally we can define
                  a place as a region in space, in which a fixed set
                  of landmarks can be observed from anywhere in the
                  region, and relationships between them do not change
                  in some appropriate qualitative sense. Data about
                  places is stored in structures called viewframes,
                  boundaries and orientation regions},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents an approach to learning an
                  optimal behavioral parameterization in the framework
                  of a Case-Based Reasoning methodology for autonomous
                  navigation tasks. It is based on our previous work
                  on a behavior-based robotic system that also
                  employed spatio-temporal case-based reasoning in the
                  selection of behavioral parameters but was not
                  capable of learning new parameterizations. The
                  present method extends the case-based reasoning
                  module by making it capable of learning new and
                  optimizing the existing cases where each case is a
                  set of behavioral parameters. The learning process
                  can either be a separate training process or be part
                  of the mission execution. In either case, the robot
                  learns an optimal parameterization of its behavior
                  for different environments it encounters. The goal
                  of this research is not only to automatically
                  optimize the performance of the robot but also to
                  avoid the manual configuration of behavioral
                  parameters and the initial configuration of a case
                  library, both of which require the user to possess
                  good knowledge of robot behavior and the performance
                  of numerous experiments. The presented method was
                  integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and
                  evaluated in extensive computer simulations, showing
                  a significant increase in the performance over a
                  nonadaptive system and a performance comparable to a
                  non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded case

  Abstract =	 {Mobile robot map building is the task of generating
                  a model of an environment from sensor data. Most
                  existing approaches to mobile robot mapping either
                  build topological representations or generate
                  accurate, metric maps of an environment. In this
                  paper we introduce relational object maps, a novel
                  approach to building metric maps that represent
                  individual objects such as doors or walls. We show
                  how to extend relational Markov networks in order to
                  reason about a hierarchy of objects and the spatial
                  relationships between them. Markov chain Monte Carlo
                  is used for ef cient inference and to learn the
                  parameters of the model. We show that the spatial
                  constraints modeled by our mapping technique yield
                  drastic improvements for labeling line segments
                  extracted from laser rangefinders. },

  Abstract =	 {This paper introduces a computational framework for
                  reasoning in Bayesian belief networks that derives
                  significant advantages from focused inference and
                  relevance reasoning. This framework is based on d
                  -separation and other simple and computationally
                  efficient techniques for pruning irrelevant parts of
                  a network. Our main contribution is a technique that
                  we call relevance-based
                  decomposition. Relevance-based decomposition
                  approaches belief updating in large networks by
                  focusing on their parts and decomposing them into
                  partially overlapping subnetworks. This makes
                  reasoning in some intractable networks possible and,
                  in addition, often results in significant speedup,
                  as the total time taken to update all subnetworks is
                  in practice often considerably less than the time
                  taken to update the network as a whole. We report
                  results of empirical tests that demonstrate
                  practical significance of our approach.},

  Abstract =	 {J. A. George \cite{George73siam} has discovered a
                  method, called nested dissection, for solving a
                  system of linear equations defined on an $n = k
                  \times k$ square grid in $O(n \log n)$ and space
                  $O(n^{3/2})$ time. We generalize this method without
                  degrading the time and space bounds so that it
                  applies to any system of equations defined on a
                  planar or almost-planar graph. Such systems arise in
                  the solution of two-dimensional finite element
                  problems. Our method uses the fact that planar
                  graphs have good separators. More generally, we show
                  that sparse Gaussian elimination is efficient for
                  any class of graphs which have good separators, and
                  conversely that graphs without good separators
                  (including "almost all" sparse graphs) are not
                  amenable to sparse Gaussian elimination.},

  R-Mathscinet = {The problem is one of numerical analysis, namely
                  saving time and space while solving sparse systems
                  of linear equations by elimination; the approach is
                  purely graph-theoretic. If the system has many zero
                  coefficients and they are appropriately distributed,
                  a convenient order of elimination might be found
                  such that not many new nonzero coefficients arise in
                  originally zero positions and so the number of
                  necessary multiplications is low. An important
                  aspect is that the numbering algorithm itself does
                  not require many operations. A. George
                  \cite{George73siam} has found an effective numbering
                  for the system whose graph is a planar square
                  grid. For such a system of $n$ equations the number
                  of multiplications is $O(n^{3/2})$. A planar grid of
                  $n$ nodes collapses when $O(n^{1/2})$ nodes are
                  removed. The authors show that this, and not the
                  sparsity itself, is the property that is sufficient,
                  and also necessary, for the existence of a numbering
                  that gives the $O(n^{3/2})$ multiplication
                  count. So, George's numbering may be applied to the
                  equation system arising from the finite elements
                  method for the two-dimensional problem, giving again
                  $O(n^{3/2})$ multiplications. For a

                  into two (very) roughly equal subgraphs by the
                  removal of fewer than $3\surd n$ vertices. An $O(n)$
                  (and practical) algorithm for finding the partition
                  follows as a consequence of this separator
                  theorem. These results have profound consequences in
                  the solution of a number of diverse problems. The
                  major one is a dramatic generalization of the nested

                  of sparse positive-definite symmetric systems of

  Abstract =	 {The most widely used ordering scheme to reduce fills
                  and operations in sparse matrix computation is the
                  minimum-degree algorithm. The notion of multiple
                  elimination is introduced here as a modification to
                  the conventional scheme. The motivation is discussed
                  using the $k\times k$ grid model
                  problem. Experimental results indicate that the
                  modified version retains the fill-reducing property
                  of (and is often better than) the original ordering
                  algorithm and yet requires less computer time. The
                  reduction in ordering time is problem dependent, and
                  for some problems the modified algorithm can run a
                  few times faster than existing implementations of
                  the minimum-degree algorithm. The use of external

  Abstract =	 {This paper explores the fusion of inertial
                  information with vision for 3D reconstruction. A
                  method is proposed for vertical line segment
                  detection and subsequent local geometric map
                  building. Visual and inertial sensing are two
                  sensory modalities that can be explored to give
                  robust solutions on image segmentation and recovery
                  of 3D structure from images, increasing the
                  capabilities of autonomous vehicles and enlarging
                  the application potential of vision systems. From
                  the inertial sensors, a camera stereo rig, and a few
                  system parameters we can recover the 3D parameters
                  of the ground plane and vertical lines. The
                  homography between stereo images of ground points
                  can be found. By detecting the vertical line
                  segments in each image, and using the homography of
                  ground points for the foot of each segment, the
                  lines can be matched and reconstructed in 3D. The
                  mobile robot then maps the detected vertical line
                  segments in a world map as it moves. To build this
                  map an outlier removal method is implemented and a
                  statistical approach used, so that a simplified
                  metric map can be obtained for robot navigation.},

@article{Lu97,
  Abstract =	 {A robot exploring an unknown environment may need to
                  build a world model from sensor measurements. In
                  order to integrate all the frames of sensor data, it
                  is essential to align the data properly. An
                  incremental approach has been typically used in the
                  past, in which each local frame of data is aligned
                  to a cumulative global model, and then merged to the
                  model. Because dierent parts of the model are
                  updated independently while there are errors in the
                  registration, such an approach may result in an
                  inconsistent model. In this paper, we study the
                  problem of consistent registration of multiple
                  frames of measurements (range scans), together with
                  the related issues of representation and
                  manipulation of spatial uncertainties. Our approach
                  is to maintain all the local frames of data as well
                  as the relative spatial relationships between local
                  frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as
                  random variables and are derived from matching
                  pairwise scans or from odometry. Then we formulate a
                  procedure based on the maximum likelihood criterion
                  to optimally combine all the spatial
                  relations. Consistency is achieved by using all the
                  spatial relations as constraints to solve for the
                  data frame poses simultaneously. Experiments with
                  both simulated and real data will be presented.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, we present a novel method to fuse
                  observations from an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
                  and visual sensors, such that initial conditions of
                  the inertial integration, including gravity
                  estimation, can be recovered quickly and in a linear
                  manner, thus removing any need for special
                  initialization procedures. The algorithm is
                  implemented using a graphical simultaneous
                  localization and mapping like approach that
                  guarantees constant time output. This paper
                  discusses the technical aspects of the work,
                  including observability and the ability for the
                  system to estimate scale in real time. Results are
                  presented of the system, estimating the platforms
                  position, velocity, and attitude, as well as gravity
                  vector and sensor alignment and calibration on-line
                  in a built environment. This paper discusses the
                  system setup, describing the real-time integration
                  of the IMU data with either stereo or monocular
                  vision data. We focus on human motion for the
                  purposes of emulating high-dynamic motion, as well
                  as to provide a localization system for future

  R-Kuipers77Thesis ={Kevin Lynch's delightful book [] was responsible
                  for the recent surge of interest in mental images of
                  the environment. One central point is that the
                  mental image can be decomposed into symbolic
                  elements, and is not necessarily pictorial in nature
                  or properties. He distinguishes between the
                  qualities of imageability and legibility of an
                  environment. Imageability concerns the sensory
                  aspects of the environment and how its landmarks
                  evoke strong reactions. Legibility concerns the
                  structural aspects of the environment and how a
                  traveler can find his way around in it. The
                  properties that determine legibility are the ones
                  addressed by this research. .. Lynch decomposed the
                  knowledge in the cognitive map into five elements:
                  landmarks, nodes, paths, edges, and districts. Their
                  functions and relation- ships correspond roughly
                  with those of places, paths, and regions in the TOUR
                  model.},

                  errors. One is by enumerating all possible errrors
                  or the other by coming up with an invariant which
                  would capture the assumptions about the task success
                  and monitor that ivariant. Lyons in sddition to task
                  two other processes that is the invariant monitoring
                  process and the goal monitoring process. The notion
                  of invariants was also used by Donald. Ecah control
                  strategy has it's own invariant. Lyons showed how
                  the invariants can be composed based on composition
                  operators. Invariants handle only error
                  monitoring. The recovery is done by chaining the
                  recovery with the monitoring procedure},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we present a junction tree based
                  inference architecture exploiting the structure of
                  the original Bayesian network and independence
                  relations induced by evidence to improve the
                  efficiency of inference. The efficiency improvements
                  are obtained by maintaining a multiplicative
                  decomposition of clique and separator
                  potentials. Maintaining a multiplicative
                  decomposition of clique and separator potentials
                  offers a tradeoff between off-line constructed
                  junction trees and on-line exploitation of barren
                  variables and independence relations induced by
                  evidence.  We consider the impact of the proposed
                  architecture on a number of commonly performed
                  Bayesian network tasks. The tasks we consider
                  include cautious propagation of evidence,
                  determining a most probable configuration, and fast
                  retraction of evidence a long with a number of other
                  tasks. The general impression is that the proposed
                  architecture increases the computational efficiency
                  of performing these tasks.  The efficiency
                  improvement offered by the proposed architecture is
                  emphasized through empirical evaluations involving
                  large real-world Bayesian networks. We compare the
                  time and space performance of the proposed
                  architecture with non-optimized implementations of
                  the HUGIN and Shafer-Shenoy inference

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a simultaneous localization and
                  mapping algorithm suitable for large-scale visual

                  viewpoint augmented navigation (VAN) framework using
                  an extended information filter. Cholesky
                  factorization modifications are used to maintain a
                  factor of the VAN information matrix, enabling
                  efficient recovery of state estimates and
                  covariances. The algorithm is demonstrated using
                  data acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle
                  performing a visual survey of sponge
                  beds. Loop-closure observations produced by a stereo

  Abstract =	 {The paper presents an algorithm for Bayesian
                  decentralized data fusion (BDDF) and its extension
                  to information-theoretic control. The algorithm is
                  stated for a feature represented by a general
                  probability density function. Several specific
                  representations are then considered -- Gaussian,
                  discrete, Certainty Grid, and hybrid. Well known
                  algorithms for these representations are shown to
                  fit the general BDDF pattern. Stating the algorithms
                  in Bayesian terms has a practical advantage of
                  allowing a generic software implementation. It is
                  also hoped that a clear general formulation will
                  stimulate extensions to efficient non-parametric
                  representations of arbitrary distributions. The
                  algorithms are described in the context of the

                  framework for decentralized cooperative data fusion

  Abstract =	 {Based on a recent development in the area of error
                  control coding, we introduce the notion of
                  convolutional factor graphs (CFGs) as a new class of
                  probabilistic graphical models. In this context, the
                  conventional factor graphs are referred to as
                  multiplicative factor graphs (MFGs). This paper
                  shows that CFGs are natural models for probability
                  functions when summation of independent latent
                  random variables is involved. In particular, CFGs
                  capture a large class of linear models, where the
                  linearity is in the sense that the observed
                  variables are obtained as a linear transformation of
                  the latent variables taking arbitrary
                  distributions. We use Gaussian models and
                  independent factor models as examples to demonstrate
                  the use of CFGs. The requirement of a linear
                  transformation between latent variables (with
                  certain independence restriction) and the observed
                  variables, to an extent, limits the modelling
                  flexibility of CFGs. This structural restriction
                  however provides a powerful analytic tool to the
                  framework of CFGs; that is, upon taking the Fourier
                  transform of the function represented by the CFG,
                  the resulting function is represented by a MFG with
                  identical structure. This Fourier transform duality
                  allows inference problems on a CFG to be solved on
                  the corresponding dual MFG.},

                  (simultaneous localization and mapping) that works
                  in unstructured, outdoor environments. Observations
                  use dense stereo vision to measure the variance of
                  the heights in each cell of a 2D grid. Unlike other
                  grid-based SLAM algorithms, which use occupancy grid
                  maps, our algorithm uses a new mapping technique
                  that maintains a posterior distribution over the
                  height variance in each cell. To obtain a joint
                  posterior over poses and maps, we use a
                  Rao-Blackwellized particle filter: the pose
                  distribution is estimated using a particle filter,
                  and each particle has its own map that is obtained
                  through exact filtering conditioned on the particle?
                  pose. For the particle filter over pose, visual
                  odometry (VO) provides good proposal
                  distributions. In the analytical (exact) filter for
                  the map, we update the sufficient statistics of a
                  gamma distribution over the precision (inverse
                  variance) of heights in each grid cell. We
                  demonstrate performance on two outdoor courses, and
                  verify the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing
                  with ground truth data obtained using electronic

                  context: Based on dense stereo data, they capture
                  the variation in height, represented by a gamma
                  distribution. The mean of the Gaussian height
                  distribution is ignored. It is argued that the

  Abstract =	 {Moving cast shadows are a major concern for
                  foreground detection algorithms. Processing of
                  foreground images in surveillance applications
                  typically requires that such shadows have been
                  identified and removed from the detected
                  foreground. This paper presents a novel pixel-based
                  statistical approach to model moving cast shadows of
                  non-uniform and varying intensity. This approach
                  uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) learning
                  ability to build statistical models describing
                  moving cast shadows on surfaces. This statistical
                  modeling can deal with scenes with complex and
                  time-varying illumination, and prevent false
                  detection in regions where shadows cannot be
                  detected. Gaussian mixture shadow models (GMSM) are
                  automatically constructed and updated over time, are
                  easily added to a GMM architecture for foreground
                  detection, and require only a small number of
                  parameters. Results obtained with different scene
                  types show the robustness of the approach. },

  R-Franz00Ras = {Experiments on rat navigation motivated Matari�c to
                  build a robot that concatenated different wall and
                  midline following behaviours to routes and
                  graphs. The robot was equipped with a ring of
                  ultrasonic sensors and a compass. It executed a
                  single behaviour as long as the sensory conditions
                  remained qualitatively the same, e.g., as long as
                  the robot? ultrasonic sensors detected a corridor
                  leading into the south. A new behaviour was
                  triggered by arriving at a distinctive place showing
                  a qualitative change of the immediate environment
                  such as a corner or a dead end. In contrast to the
                  other approaches, the recognition of these places
                  was only determined by their context, i.e., by the
                  sequence of actions preceding the current
                  action. Thus, the only information stored in the
                  graph representation were actions, not place
                  descriptions. In the graph, each action was labelled
                  by the type of the local environment and by the
                  navigation behaviour used to traverse it (e.g.,
                  follow left wall heading south). These features
                  allowed the robot to acquire routes autonomously by
                  simply following the walls of the experimental
                  room. Routes were integrated as soon as the robot
                  encountered a previously visited local environment
                  requiring the same local navigation behaviour. This
                  shows a limitation of Matari�c? approach: The number
                  of uniquely identifiable combinations of wall type
                  and compass direction is small. In general
                  environments, the problem of perceptual aliasing
                  arises, i.e., distinct locations appear identical to
                  the robot? sensors [55]. Arriving at a new situation
                  identical to an already stored one, Matari�c? robot
                  would perform a false route integration. Thus, the
                  navigable environment remained confined to rooms
                  with a uniquely identifiable wall configuration.},

                  possible is in driving, where McCallum (1995)
                  demonstrated that a very limited set of sensory
                  information was sufficient to allow a simulated
                  vehicle to learn to drive successfully on a freeway,
                  passing slower cars in front and avoiding faster
                  cars behind. .. The work ofMcCallum (1995),

                  can learn a minimal set of perception?ction
                  sequences appropriate for freeway driving. This can

                  decision process, where the state transitions

  Abstract =	 {This paper addresses the problem of motion
                  estimation and 3-D reconstruction through visual
                  tracking with a single viewpoint sensor and in
                  particular how to generalise tracking to calibrated
                  omnidirectional cameras.We analyse different
                  minimisation approaches for the intensity-based cost
                  function (sum-ofsquared differences). In particular,
                  we propose novel variants of the efficient
                  second-order minimisation (ESM) with better
                  computational complexities and compare these
                  algorithms with the inverse composition (IC) and the
                  hyperplane approximation (HA). Issues regarding the
                  use of the IC and HA for 3-D tracking are
                  discussed. We show that even though an iteration of
                  ESM is more computationally expensive than an
                  iteration of IC, the faster convergence rate makes
                  it globally faster. The tracking algorithm was
                  validated using an omnidirectional sensor mounted on
                  a mobile robot.},

  Abstract =	 {We propose a vision-based SLAM algorithm
                  incorporating feature descriptors derived from
                  multiple views of a scene, incorporating
                  illumination and viewpoint variations. These
                  descriptors are extracted from video and then
                  applied to the challenging task of wide baseline
                  matching across significant viewpoint changes. The
                  system incorporates a single camera on a mobile
                  robot in an extended Kalman filter framework to
                  develop a 3D map of the environment and determine
                  egomotion. At the same time, the feature descriptors
                  are generated from the video sequence, which can be
                  used to localize the robot when it returns to a
                  mapped location. The kidnapped robot problem is
                  addressed by matching descriptors without any
                  estimate of position, then determining the epipolar
                  geometry with respect to a known position in the
                  map.},

                  understand the performance and limitations of BP,
                  and have led to substantial improvements. The
                  threshold phenomena exhibited by the above
                  computational problems -- the satisfiability
                  threshold or Shannon's threshold -- are nothing but
                  phase transitions, typical of macroscopic materials
                  that switch abruptly from one phase to another as a
                  result of a small change in a control
                  parameter. This happens, for example, when ice
                  changes to water at temperatures above 0ºC. In
                  physics, phase diagrams are typically studied using
                  "mean field" or more accurate "Bethe" approximations
                  in which some correlations between variables are
                  neglected. It turns out that BP message passing is a
                  Bethe approximation.},

  Abstract =	 {Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are a rapidly growing
                  area of research and development in robotics. For
                  autonomous robot operations, localization has
                  typically been calculated using GPS, external camera
                  arrays, or onboard range or vision sensing. In
                  cluttered indoor or outdoor environments, onboard
                  sensing is the only viable option. In this paper we
                  present an appearance-based approach to visual SLAM
                  on a flying MAV using only low quality vision. Our
                  approach consists of a visual place recognition
                  algorithm that operates on 1000 pixel images, a
                  lightweight visual odometry algorithm, and a visual
                  expectation algorithm that improves the recall of
                  place sequences and the precision with which they
                  are recalled as the robot flies along a similar
                  path. Using data gathered from outdoor datasets, we
                  show that the system is able to perform visual
                  recognition with low quality, intermittent visual
                  sensory data. By combining the visual algorithms
                  with the RatSLAM system, we also demonstrate how the
                  algorithms enable successful SLAM.},

  Abstract =	 {Learning and then recognizing a route, whether
                  travelled during the day or at night, in clear or
                  inclement weather, and in summer or winter is a
                  challenging task for state of the art algorithms in
                  computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we
                  present a new approach to visual navigation under
                  changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of
                  calculating the single location most likely given a
                  current image, our approach calculates the best
                  candidate matching location within every local
                  navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved
                  by recognizing coherent sequences of these
                  #x201C;local best matches #x201D;. This approach
                  removes the need for global matching performance by
                  the vision front-end - instead it must only pick the
                  best match within any short sequence of images. The
                  approach is applicable over environment changes that
                  render traditional feature-based techniques
                  ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets
                  we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
                  and compare it to one of the most successful
                  feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The
                  perceptual change in the datasets is extreme;
                  repeated traverses through environments during the
                  day and then in the middle of the night, at times
                  separated by months or years and in opposite
                  seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy
                  rain. While the feature-based method fails, the
                  sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory
                  segments at 100\% precision with recall rates of up
                  to 60\%.},

  Abstract =	 {Video-based recognition and prediction of a
                  temporally extended activity can benefit from a
                  detailed description of high-level expectations
                  about the activity. Stochastic grammars allow for an
                  efficient representation of such expectations and
                  are well-suited for the specification of temporally
                  well-ordered activities. In this paper, we extend
                  stochastic grammars by adding event parameters,
                  state checks, and sensitivity to an internal scene
                  model. We present an implemented system that uses
                  human-specified grammars to recognize a person
                  performing the Towers of Hanoi task from a video
                  sequence by analyzing object interaction
                  events. Experimental results from several videos

                  constituent sub-tasks even though no appearance
                  models of the objects in the video are provided.
                  These experiments include videos of the task

  Abstract =	 {We present an approach to activity discovery, the
                  unsupervised identification and modeling of human
                  actions embedded in a larger sensor stream.
                  Activity discovery can be seen as the inverse of the
                  activity recognition problem.  Rather than learn
                  models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to
                  discover motifs, sets of similar subsequences within
                  the raw sensor stream, without the benefit of labels
                  or manual segmentation.  These motifs are
                  statistically unlikely and thus typically correspond
                  to important or characteristic actions within the
                  activity. The problem of activity discovery differs
                  from typical motif discovery, such as locating
                  protein binding sites, because of the nature of time
                  series data representing human activity.  For
                  example, in activity data, motifs will tend to be
                  sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only
                  exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate
                  time warping.  In this paper, we motivate the
                  activity discovery problem and present our approach
                  for efficient discovery of meaningful actions from
                  sensor data representing human activity.  We
                  empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise
                  data set captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis
                  inertial sensor.  Our algorithm successfully
                  discovers motifs that correspond to the real
                  exercises with a recall rate of 96.3 percent and
                  overall accuracy of 86.7 percent over six exercises
                  and 864 occurrences.},

                  persistent dynamic behavior in time, such an
                  assumption is violated and detection performance
                  deteriorates. In this paper, we propose a new method
                  for the modeling and subtraction of such
                  scenes. Towards the modeling of the dynamic
                  characteristics, optical flow is computed and
                  utilized as a feature in a higher dimensional
                  space. Inherent ambiguities in the computation of
                  features are addressed by using a data-dependent
                  bandwidth for density estimation using
                  kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
                  utility and performance of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract =	 {Background modeling and subtraction is a core compo-
                  nent in motion analysis. The central idea behind
                  such module is to create a probabilistic
                  representation of the static scene that is compared
                  with the current input to perform subtraction. Such
                  approach is efficient when the scene to be modeled
                  refers to a static structure with limited
                  perturbation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of modeling dynamic scenes where the assumption of a
                  static background is not valid. Waving trees,
                  beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or
                  snow are examples. We propose an on-line
                  auto-regressive model to capture and predict the
                  behavior of such scenes. Towards detection of events
                  we introduce a new metric that is based on a
                  state-driven comparison between the prediction and
                  the actual frame. Promising results demonstrate the
                  potentials of the proposed framework.},

  Abstract =	 {The problem of representation and handling of
                  constraints is here considered, mainly for picture
                  processing purposes. A systematic specification and
                  utilization of the available constraints could
                  significantly reduce the amount of search in picture
                  recognition. On the other hand, formally stated
                  constraints can be embedded in the syntactic
                  productions of picture languages. Only binary
                  constraints are treated here, but they are
                  represented in full generality as binary
                  relations. Constraints among more than two variables
                  are then represented as networks of simultaneous
                  binary relations. In general, more than one
                  equivalent (i.e., representing the same constraint)
                  network can be found: a minimal equivalent network
                  is shown to exist, and its computation is shown to
                  solve most practical problems about constraint
                  handling. No exact solution for this central problem
                  was found. Anyway, constraints are treated
                  algebraically, and the solution of a system of
                  linear equations in this algebra provides an
                  approximation of the minimal network. This solution
                  is then proved exact in special cases, e.g., for
                  tree-like and series-parallel networks and for
                  classes of relations for which a distributive
                  property holds. This latter condition is satisfied
                  in cases of practical interest.},

  Abstract =	 {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and
                  accurately map its surroundings is considered by
                  many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous
                  robots. However, few approaches to this problem
                  scale up to handle the very large number of
                  landmarks present in real environments. Kalman
                  filter-based algorithms, for example, require time
                  quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate
                  each sensor observation. This paper presents
                  FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates
                  the full posterior distribution over robot pose and
                  landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with
                  the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm
                  is based on an exact factorization of the posterior
                  into a product of conditional landmark distributions
                  and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm
                  has been run successfully on as many as 50,000
                  landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of
                  previous approaches. Experimental results
                  demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the
                  FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and realworld

  Abstract =	 {Recent work has shown that the probabilistic SLAM
                  approach of explicit uncertainty propagation can
                  succeed in permitting repeatable 3D real-time
                  localization and mapping even in the 'pure vision'
                  domain of a single agile camera with no extra
                  sensing. An issue which has caused difficulty in
                  monocular SLAM however is the initialization of
                  features, since information from multiple images
                  acquired during motion must be combined to achieve
                  accurate depth estimates. This has led algorithms to
                  deviate from the desirable Gaussian uncertainty
                  representation of the EKF and related probabilistic
                  filters during special initialization steps. In this
                  paper we present a new unified parametrization for
                  point features within monocular SLAM which permits
                  efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty
                  during undelayed initialisation and beyond, all
                  within the standard EKF (Extended Kalman
                  Filter). The key concept is direct parametrization
                  of inverse depth, where there is a high degree of
                  linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features which are so far from the camera that
                  they present little parallax during motion,

                  graph, where the vertices encode views from the
                  robot? environment and the edges the spatial
                  relationship between these views. The views are
                  represented through their SIFT keypoints. The
                  proposed map learning method has been successfully
                  applied to a homing application.},

  Abstract =	 {Pose estimation of outdoor robots presents some
                  distinct challenges due to the various uncertainties
                  in the robot sensing and action. In particular,
                  global positioning sensors of outdoor robots do not
                  always work perfectly, causing large drift in the
                  location estimate of the robot. To overcome this
                  common problem, we propose a new approach for global
                  localization using place recognition. First, we
                  learn the location of some arbitrary key places
                  using odometry measurements and GPS measurements
                  only at the start and the end of the robot
                  trajectory. In subsequent runs, when the robot
                  perceives a key place, our fixed-lag smoother fuses
                  odometry measurements with the relative location to
                  the key place to improve its pose estimate. Outdoor
                  mobile robot experiments show that place recognition
                  measurements significantly improve the estimate of
                  the smoother in the absence of GPS measurements.},

  Abstract =	 {Four experiments investigated the nature of spatial
                  representations used in locomotion. Participants
                  learned the layout of several objects and then
                  pointed to the objects while blindfolded in 3
                  conditions: before turning (baseline), after turning
                  to a new heading (updating), and after
                  disorientation (disorientation). The internal
                  consistency of pointing in the disorientation
                  condition was relatively high and equivalent to that
                  in the baseline and updating conditions, when the
                  layout had salient intrinsic axes and the
                  participants learned the locations of the objects on
                  the periphery of the layout. The internal
                  consistency of pointing was disrupted by
                  disorientation when participants learned the
                  locations of objects while standing amid them and
                  the layout did not have salient intrinsic axes. It
                  was also observed that many participants retrieved
                  spatial relations after disorientation from the
                  original learning heading. These results indicate
                  that people form an allocentric representation of
                  object-to-object spatial relations when they learn
                  the layout of a novel environment and use that
                  representation to locate objects around
                  them. Egocentric representations may be used to
                  locate objects when allocentric representations are

                  when the same exteroceptive sensor measurement is
                  processed for the computation of two consecutive
                  displacement estimates (both forward and backward in
                  time) these estimates are correlated, and an
                  analysis of the exact structure of the correlations
                  is performed. This analysis is utilized in the
                  design of data fusion algorithms, that correctly

                  this work is the derivation of a measurement model
                  that is able to express the geometric constraints
                  that arise when a static feature is observed from
                  multiple camera poses. This measurement model does
                  not require including the 3D feature position in the
                  state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to
                  linearization errors. The vision-aided inertial

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, we present a localization algorithm
                  for estimating the 3D position and orientation
                  (pose) of a moving vehicle based on visual and
                  inertial measurements. The main advantage of the
                  proposed method is that it provides precise pose
                  estimates at low computational cost. This is
                  achieved by introducing a two-layer estimation
                  architecture that processes measurements based on
                  their information content. Inertial measurements and
                  feature tracks between consecutive images are
                  processed locally in the first layer
                  (Multi-State-Constraint Kalman filter) providing
                  estimates for the motion of the vehicle at a high
                  rate. The second layer comprises a bundle adjustment
                  iterative estimator that operates intermittently so
                  as to (i) reduce the effect of the linearization
                  errors, and (ii) update the state estimates every
                  time an area is re-visited and features are
                  re-detected (loop closure). Through this process
                  reliable state estimates are available continuously,
                  while the estimation errors remain bounded during
                  long-term operation. The performance of the
                  developed system is demonstrated in large-scale

  Abstract =	 {In recent years, autonomous miniature airships have
                  gained increased interest in the robotics
                  community. This is due to their ability to move
                  safely and hover for extended periods of time. The
                  major constraints of miniature airships come from
                  their limited payload which introduces substantial
                  constraints on their perceptional capabilities. In
                  this paper, we consider the problem of localizing a
                  miniature blimp with lightweight ultrasound
                  sensors. Since the opening angle of the sound cone
                  emitted by a sonar sensor depends on the diameter of
                  the membrane, small-size sonar devices introduce the
                  problem of high uncertainty about which object has
                  been perceived. We present a novel sensor model for
                  ultrasound sensors with large opening angles that
                  allows an autonomous blimp to robustly localize
                  itself in a known environment using Monte Carlo
                  localization. As we demonstrate in experiments with
                  a real blimp, our novel sensor model outperforms a
                  popular sensor model that has in the past been shown
                  to work reliably on wheeled platforms.},

@article{Murphy04smc,
  Abstract =	 {Rescue robotics has been suggested by a recent
                  DARPA/NSF study as an application domain for the
                  research in human-robot integration (HRI). This
                  paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are
                  currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and
                  discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past
                  eight years. A domain theory of the search activity
                  is formulated. The domain theory consists of two
                  parts: 1) a workflow model identifying the major
                  tasks, actions, and roles in robot-assisted search
                  (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general
                  information flow model of how data from the robot is
                  fused by various team members into information and
                  knowledge. The information flow model also captures
                  the types of situation awareness needed by each
                  agent in the rescue robot system. The article
                  presents a synopsis of the major HRI issues in
                  reducing the number of humans it takes to control a
                  robot, maintaining performance with geographically
                  distributed teams with intermittent communications,
                  and encouraging acceptance within the existing
                  social structure.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, the problem of fully decentralized
                  data fusion and control for a modular wheeled mobile
                  robot (WMR) is addressed. This is a vehicle system
                  with nonlinear kinematics, distributed multiple
                  sensors, and nonlinear sensor models. The problem is
                  solved by applying fully decentralized estimation
                  and control algorithms based on the extended
                  information filter. This is achieved by deriving a
                  modular, decentralized kinematic model by using
                  plane motion kinematics to obtain the forward and
                  inverse kinematics for a generalized simple wheeled
                  vehicle. This model is then used in the
                  decentralized estimation and control algorithms. WMR
                  estimation and control is thus obtained locally
                  using reduced order models with reduced
                  communication requirements, in a scalable network of
                  control nodes. If communication of information
                  between nodes is carried out after every measurement
                  (full rate communication), the estimates and control
                  signals obtained at each node are equivalent to
                  those obtained by a corresponding centralized
                  system. Transputer architecture is used as the basis
                  for hardware and software design as it supports the
                  extensive communication and concurrency requirements
                  that characterize modular and decentralized
                  systems. The advantages of a modular WMR vehicle
                  include scalability, application flexibility, low
                  prototyping costs, and high reliability.},

  Abstract =	 {Themes emerging from the collection of articles in
                  the Special Section on Long-Term Spatial Memory
                  include the notion of multiple spatial systems, the
                  relation between spatial representations and
                  episodic memory, the role of context, and the neural
                  systems involved in space. The authors conclude that
                  distinguishing between egocentric and allocentric
                  spatial systems makes sense of both behavioral and
                  neurobiological data. The special role of the

                  ?patial?system. Second, I will discuss our
                  assumption that the spatial memory system we
                  allocated to the hippocampus was but one of many
                  spatial systems, and that the role of these various
                  systems can best be understood if one takes into
                  consideration an animal? behavior in its natural
                  habitat. Third, I will briefly discuss our view that
                  in the human hippocampus, at least in the left
                  hemisphere, the mapping system represents something
                  more abstract than physical space.},

@inproceedings{Narasimhan05oceans,
  Abstract =	 { Virtually all structured light methods in computer
                  vision assume that the scene and the sources are
                  immersed in pure air and that light is neither
                  scattered nor absorbed. Recently, however,
                  structured lighting has found growing application in
                  underwater and aerial imaging, where scattering
                  effects cannot be ignored. In this paper, we present
                  a comprehensive analysis of two representative
                  methods - light stripe range scanning and
                  photometric stereo - in the presence of
                  scattering. For both methods, we derive physical
                  models for the appearances of a surface immersed in
                  a scattering medium. Based on these models, we
                  present results on (a) the condition for object
                  detectability in light striping and (b) the number
                  of sources required for photometric stereo. In both
                  cases, we demonstrate that while traditional methods
                  fail when scattering is significant, our methods
                  accurately recover the scene (depths, normals,
                  albedos) as well as the properties of the
                  medium. These results are in turn used to restore
                  the appearances of scenes as if they were captured
                  in clear air. Although we have focused on light
                  striping and photometric stereo, our approach can
                  also be extended to other methods such as grid
                  coding, gated and active polarization imaging.},

  Abstract =	 {Homing is the process by which an autonomous system
                  guides itself to a particular location on the basis
                  of sensory input. In this paper, a method of visual
                  homing using an associative memory based on a simple
                  pattern classifier is described. Homing is
                  accomplished without the use of an explicit world
                  model by utilizing direct associations between
                  learned visual patterns and system motor
                  commands. The method is analyzed in terms of a
                  pattern space and conditions obtained that allow the
                  system performance to be predicted on the basis of
                  statistical measurements on the environment. Results

                  theoretical analysis of the associative memory used
                  in his approach. Instead of a mobile robot, Nelson
                  used a small camera mounted on a robot arm which
                  could move at a fixed height over a miniature city
                  called ?inytown? Places were recognized from the
                  bird? eye view of the camera. Each camera image of a
                  location was divided into a 5 ?5 grid of adjacent
                  subwindows in which the predominant edge direction
                  was determined. In the training phase, Nelson?
                  system learned associations between local edge
                  orientation patterns with directions towards the
                  goal in the town centre at 120 preselected places
                  covering Tinytown. Homing was accomplished by
                  comparing the currently perceived pattern against
                  all patterns stored in the associative memory, and
                  moving into the specified direction of the winning
                  pattern. Nelson? system was able to find the goal
                  from almost all places in Tinytown and thus
                  demonstrated the feasability of
                  recognition-triggered responses in robot
                  applications. However, his system relied on some
                  idealizations: pictures were taken in exactly the
                  same camera orientation, the system had to be
                  trained at all possible locations and could not
                  select places autonomously.},

                  Posteriori (MAP) estimator for multi-robot
                  Cooperative Localization (CL). As opposed to
                  centralized MAP-based CL, the proposed algorithm
                  reduces the memory and processing requirements by
                  distributing data and computations amongst the
                  robots. Specifically, a distributed data-allocation
                  scheme is presented that enables robots to
                  simultaneously process and update their local
                  data. Additionally, a distributed Conjugate Gradient
                  algorithm is employed that reduces the cost of
                  computing the MAP estimates, while utilizing all
                  available resources in the team and increasing
                  robustness to single-point failures. Finally, a
                  computationally efficient distributed
                  marginalization of past robot poses is introduced
                  for limiting the size of the optimization
                  problem. The communication and computational
                  complexity of the proposed algorithm is described in

                  presented for validating the performance of the

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a closed form solution to the
                  multiple platform simultaneous localisation and map
                  building (SLAM) problem. Closed form solutions are
                  presented in both state space and information based
                  forms. A key conclusion of this paper is that the
                  information-state based form offers many advantages
                  over the state space formulation in allowing the
                  SLAM algorithm to be decentralised across multiple
                  platforms. The benefits of operating SLAM in an
                  information form are numerous. The additive
                  properties of the information update make it
                  especially attractive, as does the ability to
                  predict estimates through any direction in
                  time. However, of paramount importance is the
                  well-known ability to decentralise the information
                  filter. A general form of the continuous time
                  inverse covariance matrix for the SLAM problem is
                  presented to determine such properties as the
                  initial and steady state conditions. These
                  properties are investigated to determine their
                  dependence and relationship to both the observation
                  and process noise. Examination of the structure of
                  the general form of the inverse covariance matrix
                  also gives an insight into what information should
                  be communicated between platforms in the
                  decentralised architecture and how it can be
                  managed. },

  C-Rosencrantz03Uai ={In a recent result [this], it was shown that
                  scalable decentralized state estimation can be
                  achieved for static environments with Gaussian error
                  - that is, environments where the state does not
                  change over time and observations are
                  (approximately) linear functions of the state with
                  Gaussian error. The key insight in [this] is that in
                  static worlds, information can be accumulated at any
                  time and in any order, regardless of the time at
                  which it was acquired. Furthermore, because of the
                  simple form of the observations, there is a simple
                  algorithm for accumulating local evidence in the
                  form of additive information
                  matrices. Unfortunately, the "trick" of additive
                  information works only for distributions (such as

                  collaborating vehicles where the communication
                  bandwidth is limited. We present a novel SLAM
                  algorithm that enables multiple vehicles to acquire
                  a joint map, but which can cope with arbitrary
                  latency and bandwidth limitations such as typically
                  found in airborne vehicle applications. The key idea
                  is to represent maps in information form (negative
                  log-likelihood), and to selectively communicate
                  subsets of the information tailored to the available
                  communication resources. We show that our
                  communication scheme preserves the consistency,
                  which has important ramifications for data
                  association problems. We also provide experimental

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a 3D SLAM system using
                  information from an actuated laser scanner and
                  camera installed on a mobile robot. The laser
                  samples the local geometry of the environment and is
                  used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of
                  the workspace. Sequences of images from the camera
                  are used to detect loop closure events (without
                  reference to the internal estimates of vehicle
                  location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval
                  system. The loop closure detection is robust to
                  repetitive visual structure and provides a
                  probabilistic measure of confidence. The images
                  suggesting loop closure are then further processed
                  with their corresponding local laser scans to yield
                  putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We
                  show how naive application of this transformation to
                  effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic
                  linearization errors and go on to describe a way in
                  which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be
                  successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system
                  working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing
                  substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving
                  traversals. The results are overlaid on an aerial
                  image to provide a ground truth comparison with the
                  estimated map. The paper concludes with an extension
                  into the multi-robot domain in which 3D maps
                  resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common
                  reference frame) are combined without recourse to
                  mutual observation},

                  stereo head or a single moving camera based on video
                  input. The system operates in real-time with low
                  delay and the motion estimates are used for
                  navigational purposes. The front end of the system
                  is a feature tracker. Point features are matched
                  between pairs of frames and linked into image
                  trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the
                  camera motion are then produced from the feature
                  tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test
                  architecture. This generates what we call visual
                  odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input
                  alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the
                  motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be

                  sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel
                  encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been
                  applied successfully to video from aerial,
                  automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on

  Abstract =	 {We present a method for estimating the global
                  uncertainty of epipolar geometry with applications
                  to autonomous vehicle navigation. Such uncertainty
                  information is necessary for making informed
                  decisions regarding the confidence of a motion
                  estimate, since we must otherwise accept the
                  estimate without any knowledge of the probability
                  that the estimate is in error. For example, we may
                  wish to fuse visual estimates with information from
                  GPS and inertial sensors, but without uncertainty
                  information, we have no principled way to do
                  so. Ideally, we would perform a full search over the
                  7-dimensional space of fundamental matrices to yield
                  an estimate and its related uncertainty. However,
                  searching this space is computationally
                  infeasible. As a compromise between fully
                  representing posterior likelihood over this space
                  and producing a single estimate, we represent the
                  uncertainty over the space of translation directions
                  in a calibrated framework. In contrast to finding a
                  single estimate, representing the posterior
                  likelihood is always a well-posed problem, albeit an
                  often computationally challenging one. Given the
                  posterior likelihood, we derive a confidence
                  interval around the motion estimate. We verify the
                  correctness of the confidence interval using
                  synthetic data and show examples of uncertainty
                  estimates using vehicle-mounted camera sequences.},

  Abstract =	 {Architectural legibility is the degree to which the
                  designed features of the environment aid people in
                  creating an effective mental image, or "cognitive
                  map" of the spatial relationships within a building,
                  and the subsequent ease of wayfinding within the
                  environment. However, little research has attempted
                  to operationalize legibility by examining the
                  relationship between objective measures of the
                  physical environment, the cognitive map, and
                  observational measures of wayfinding
                  performance. This article empirically assesses the
                  effects of one environmental variable, topological
                  floor plan complexity, on the cognitive mapping and
                  wayfinding performance of 63 participants within
                  three building settings. The study finds that this
                  objective measure of floor plan complexity
                  significantly influences cognitive mapping and
                  observed wayfinding. Given these results, a
                  conceptual model of one aspect of architectural
                  legibility was developed and empirically
                  tested. Path analysis was used to assess the
                  relationship between topological plan configuration,
                  four convergent measures of the cognitive map, and
                  observational measures of human wayfinding
                  performance. Analysis of these data provide support
                  for the conceptual model. The model suggests that
                  the complexity of topological plan configuration
                  influences legibility. The evidence also indicates
                  that the relationship between plan configuration and
                  wayfinding is mediated by the accuracy of the
                  cognitive map.},

  Abstract =	 {Background subtraction is a commonly used process in
                  surveillance systems. One dificult problem when
                  using the process is maintaining a correct
                  background image against changing illumination
                  conditions. Most methods for maintaining the
                  background image are based on intuitive definitions
                  about the illumination change and are implemented as
                  somewhat ad hoc algorithms. In contrast, we first
                  define mathematical models representing the relation
                  between the illumination intensity, a rejection
                  index of objects and a pixel value. We also
                  mathematically define an assumption about
                  illumination, which requires that the distribution
                  of the illumination intensity in a small region does
                  not change Then we formalize the background
                  subtraction problem as a statistical test based on
                  the models and assunip tion. The experinients show
                  that our models appropriately express the imaging
                  process of a camera and our method' provides stable
                  detection performance for foreground objects.},

                  that for every connected component $G(X)$ of
                  $G(V-P)$ there exists a $u,v$ chain in

  Abstract =	 {We describe a real-time computer vision and machine
                  learning system for modeling and recognizing human
                  behaviors in a visual surveillance task. The system
                  is particularly concerned with detecting when
                  interactions between people occur and classifying
                  the type of interaction. Examples of interesting
                  interaction behaviors include following another
                  person, altering one's path to meet another, and so
                  forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up
                  information in a closed feedback loop, with both
                  components employing a statistical Bayesian
                  approach. We propose and compare two different
                  state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and
                  CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. The
                  CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently
                  and accurately. Finally, to deal with the problem of
                  limited training data, a synthetic Alife-style
                  training system is used to develop flexible prior
                  models for recognizing human interactions. We
                  demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models
                  to accurately classify real human behaviors and
                  interactions with no additional tuning or training.},

  Abstract =	 {A robot exploring an environment can estimate its
                  own motion and the relative positions of features in
                  the environment. Simultaneous Localization and
                  Mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these
                  estimates to produce a map and a robot
                  trajectory. The constraints are generally
                  non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear
                  optimization problem. The optimization can be
                  difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising
                  from odometry data, and due to the size of the state
                  space. We present a fast non-linear optimization
                  algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot
                  trajectory, even when given a poor initial
                  estimate. Our approach uses a variant of Stochastic
                  Gradient Descent on an alternative state-space
                  representation that has good stability and
                  computational properties.We compare our algorithm to
                  several others, using both real and synthetic data
                  sets.},

                  reduced the overall complexity of the
                  representation. Alternatively when dealing with
                  large databases, it is desirable to use a global
                  descriptor, to preselect small a number of
                  candidates before carrying out recognition based on
                  local features. For this stage color histograms were
                  used, because of their simplicity and robustness to
                  changes in object?�s scale, orientation and to some

  Abstract =	 {Background subtraction is a widely used paradigm to
                  detect moving objects in video taken from a static
                  camera and is used for various important
                  applications such as video surveillance, human
                  motion analysis, etc. Various statistical approaches
                  have been proposed for modeling a given scene
                  background. However, there is no theoretical
                  framework for choosing which features to use to
                  model different regions of the scene background. In
                  this paper we introduce a novel framework for
                  feature selection for background modeling and
                  subtraction. A boosting algorithm, namely RealBoost,
                  is used to choose the best combination of features
                  at each pixel. Given the probability estimates from
                  a pool of features calculated by Kernel Density
                  Estimate (KDE) over a certain time period, the
                  algorithm selects the most useful ones to
                  discriminate foreground objects from the scene
                  background. The results show that the proposed
                  framework successfully selects appropriate features
                  for different parts of the image.},

  Abstract =	 {Probabilistic inference problems arise naturally in
                  distributed systems such as sensor networks and
                  teams of mobile robots. Inference algorithms that
                  use message passing are a natural fit for
                  distributed systems, but they must be robust to the
                  failure situations that arise in real-world
                  settings, such as unreliable communication and node
                  failures. Unfortunately, the popular sum-product
                  algorithm can yield very poor estimates in these
                  settings because the nodes' beliefs before
                  convergence can be arbitrarily different from the
                  correct posteriors. In this paper, we present a new
                  message passing algorithm for probabilistic
                  inference which provides several crucial guarantees
                  that the standard sum-product algorithm does
                  not. Not only does it converge to the correct
                  posteriors, but it is also guaranteed to yield a
                  principled approximation at any point before
                  convergence. In addition, the computational
                  complexity of the message passing updates depends
                  only upon the model, and is independent of the
                  network topology of the distributed system. We
                  demonstrate the approach with detailed experimental
                  results on a distributed sensor calibration task
                  using data from an actual sensor network

  Abstract =	 {Many inference problems that arise in sensor
                  networks require the computation of a global
                  conclusion that is consistent with local information
                  known to each node. A large class of these problems
                  - including probabilistic inference, regression, and
                  control problems - can be solved by message passing
                  on a data structure called a junction tree. In this
                  paper, we present a distributed architecture for
                  solving these problems that is robust to unreliable
                  communication and node failures. In this
                  architecture, the nodes of the sensor network
                  assemble themselves into a junction tree and
                  exchange messages between neighbors to solve the
                  inference problem efficiently and exactly. A key
                  part of the architecture is an efficient distributed
                  algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction tree
                  to minimize the communication and computation
                  required by inference. We present experimental
                  results from a prototype implementation on a 97-node
                  Mica2 mote network, as well as simulation results
                  for three applications: distributed sensor
                  calibration, optimal control, and sensor field
                  modeling. These experiments demonstrate that our
                  distributed architecture can solve many important

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we describe a system that carries out
                  SLAM using a stereo pair moving with 6DOF as the
                  only sensor. Textured point features are extracted
                  from the images and stored as 3D points if seen in
                  both images with sufficient disparity, or stored as
                  inverse 3D points otherwise. This allows the system
                  to make use of both near and far features that
                  provide distance and orientation, or orientation
                  information, respectively. Unlike other vision only
                  SLAM systems, stereo does not suffer from ?cale
                  drift?because of unobservability problems, and thus
                  no other information such as gyroscopes or
                  accelerometers is required. Our SLAM algorithm
                  generates sequences of conditionally independent
                  local maps that can share information related to the
                  camera motion and common features being tracked. The
                  system computes the full map using the Divide and
                  Conquer algorithm adapted for conditionally
                  independent local maps, allowing linear time
                  execution. We show experimental results in outdoor
                  urban environments that demonstrate the robustness
                  and scalability of our system.},

  Abstract =	 {Recent successful SLAM methods employ hybrid map
                  representations combining the strengths of
                  topological maps and occupancy grids. Such
                  representations often facilitate multi-agent
                  mapping. In this paper, a successful SLAM method is
                  presented, which is inspired by the manifold data
                  structure by Howard et al. This method maintains a
                  graph with sensor observations stored in vertices
                  and pose differences including uncertainty
                  information stored in edges. Through its graph
                  structure, updates are local and can be efficiently
                  communicated to peers. The graph links represent
                  known traversable space, and facilitate tasks like
                  path planning. We demonstrate that our SLAM method
                  produces very detailed maps without sacrificing
                  scalability. The presented method was used by the
                  UvA Rescue Virtual Robots team, which won the Best
                  Mapping Award in the RoboCup Rescue Virtual Robots
                  competition in 2006.},

                  vision for the detection of forcground objects in a

                  model, the more correct is the detection of the

                  approach to background modeling based on a
                  mean-shift procedure. The mean shift vector
                  convergence properties enable the system to achieve
                  reliable background modeling. In addition,
                  histogram-based compulation and the new concept of
                  local basins of attraction allow us to meet the

  Abstract =	 {Robotic underwater vehicles are regularly performing
                  vast optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists
                  value these surveys since optical images offer high
                  levels of detail and are easily interpreted by
                  humans. Unfortunately, the coverage of a single
                  image is limited by absorption and backscatter while
                  what is generally desired is an overall view of the
                  survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics
                  assume planar scenes and are applicable only to
                  situations without much relief. We present a
                  complete and validated system for processing optical
                  images acquired from an underwater robotic vehicle
                  to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our
                  approach is designed for the most general conditions
                  of wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence
                  of significant 3D structure) and scales to hundreds
                  or thousands of images. We only assume a calibrated
                  camera system and a vehicle with uncertain and
                  possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a compass,
                  depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our
                  approach is based on a combination of techniques
                  from computer vision, photogrammetry, and
                  robotics. We use a local to global approach to
                  structure from motion, aided by the navigation
                  sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D
                  sub-maps. These sub-maps are then placed in a common
                  reference frame that is refined by matching
                  overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing
                  is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D
                  structure, camera poses, and uncertainty estimates
                  in a consistent reference frame. We present results
                  with ground truth for structure as well as results
                  from an oceanographic survey over a coral reef.},

  Abstract =	 {The visual recognition of three-dimensional (3-D)
                  objects on the basis of their shape poses at least
                  two difficult problems. First, there is the problem
                  of variable illumination, which can be addressed by
                  working with relatively stable features such as
                  intensity edges rather than the raw intensity
                  images. Second, there is the problem of the
                  initially unknown pose of the object relative to the
                  viewer. In one approach to this problem, a
                  hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then
                  the appearance of a model object from such a
                  viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual
                  image. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D
                  models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D
                  models is itself a difficult problem. To address
                  this problem in computational vision, we have
                  developed a scheme, based on the theory of
                  approximation of multivariate functions, that learns
                  from a small set of perspective views a function
                  mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network
                  equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the
                  object on which it was trained from any viewpoint.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a novel algorithm to detect and remove
                  cast shadows in a video sequence by taking advantage
                  of the statistical prevalence of the shadowed
                  regions over the object regions. We model shadows
                  using multivariate Gaussians. We apply a weak
                  classifier as a prefilter. We project shadow models
                  into a quantized color space to update a shadow flow
                  function. We use shadow flow, background models, and
                  current frame to determine the shadow and object
                  regions. This method has several advantages: It does
                  not require a color space transformation. We pose
                  the problem in the RGB color space, and we can carry
                  out the same analysis in other Cartesian spaces as
                  well. It is data-driven and adapts to the changing
                  shadow conditions. In other words, accuracy of our
                  method is not limited by the preset
                  values. Furthermore, it does not assume any 3D
                  models for the target objects or tracking of the
                  cast shadows between frames. Our results show that
                  the detection performance is superior than the
                  benchmark method. },

                  well as viewing perspectives is an important
                  requirement for many computer vision
                  applications. One of the key factors in enhancing
                  the robustness of dynamic scene analysis is that of
                  accurate and reliable means for shadow
                  detection. Shadow detection is critical for correct
                  object detection in image sequences. Many algorithms
                  have been proposed in the literature that deal with
                  shadows. However, a comparative evaluation of the
                  existing approaches is still lacking. In this paper,
                  the full range of problems underlying the shadow
                  detection are identified and discussed. We classify
                  the proposed solutions to this problem using a
                  taxonomy of four main classes, called deterministic
                  model and non-model based and statistical parametric
                  and non- parametric. Novel quantitative (detection
                  and discrimination accuracy) and qualitative metrics

                  shadow situations and robustness to noise) are

  Abstract =	 {Moving shadows need careful consideration in the
                  development of robust dynamic scene analysis
                  systems. Moving shadow detection is critical for
                  accurate object detection in video streams since
                  shadow points are often misclassified as object
                  points, causing errors in segmentation and
                  tracking. Many algorithms have been proposed in the
                  literature that deal with shadows. However, a
                  comparative evaluation of the existing approaches is
                  still lacking. In this paper, we present a
                  comprehensive survey of moving shadow detection
                  approaches. We organize contributions reported in
                  the literature in four classes two of them are
                  statistical and two are deterministic. We also
                  present a comparative empirical evaluation of
                  representative algorithms selected from these four
                  classes. Novel quantitative (detection and
                  discrimination rate) and qualitative metrics (scene
                  and object independence, flexibility to shadow
                  situations, and robustness to noise) are proposed to
                  evaluate these classes of algorithms on a benchmark
                  suite of indoor and outdoor video sequences. These

  Abstract =	 {The objective of this work is to enlarge the class
                  of camera motions for which epipolar geometry and
                  image correspondences can be computed
                  automatically. This facilitates matching between
                  quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two
                  extensions are made to the current small baseline
                  algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint
                  invariant measure is developed for assessing the
                  affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs;
                  second, algorithms are given for generating putative
                  corner matches between image pairs using local
                  homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments
                  are also described: the automatic generation of
                  local homographies, and the combination of possibly
                  conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC
                  estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is
                  demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying
                  relative motion, and for different scene types. All
                  processing is automatic},

  Abstract =	 {While probabilistic techniques have been considered
                  extensively in the context of metric maps, no
                  general purpose probabilistic methods exist for
                  topological maps. We present the concept of
                  Probabilistic Topological Maps (PTMs), a
                  sample-based representation that approximates the
                  posterior distribution over topologies given the
                  available sensor measurements. The PTM is obtained
                  through the use of MCMC-based Bayesian inference
                  over the space of all possible topologies. It is
                  shown that the space of all topologies is equivalent
                  to the space of set partitions of all available
                  measurements. While the space of possible topologies
                  is intractably large, our use of Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo sampling to infer the approximate histograms
                  overcomes the combinatorial nature of this space and
                  provides a general solution to the correspondence
                  problem in the context of topological mapping. We
                  present experimental results that validate our
                  technique and generate good maps even when using
                  only odometry as the sensor measurements.},

  Abstract =	 {Smoothing approaches to the Simultaneous
                  Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem in robotics
                  are superior to the more common filtering approaches
                  in being exact, better equipped to deal with
                  non-linearities, and computing the entire robot
                  trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that
                  perform map updates in constant time exist, no
                  analogous smoothing method is available. We aim to
                  rectify this situation by presenting a
                  smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy Belief
                  Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory
                  and map updates in constant time except when a loop
                  is closed in the environment. The SLAM problem is
                  represented as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF)
                  over which LBP is performed. We prove that LBP, in
                  this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel relaxation
                  of a linear system. The inability to compute
                  marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing
                  algorithm has previously been a stumbling block to
                  their widespread use. LBP enables the efficient
                  recovery of the marginal covariances, albeit
                  approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the
                  final covariances are overconfident, the ones
                  obtained from a spanning tree of the GMRF are
                  conservative, making them useful for data
                  association. Experiments in simulation and using
                  real data are presented.},

  Abstract =	 {We present an algorithm for pose estimation using
                  fixed-lag smoothing. We show that fixed-lag
                  smoothing enables inclusion of measurements from
                  multiple asynchronous measurement sources in an
                  optimal manner. Since robots usually have a
                  plurality of uncoordinated sensors, our algorithm
                  has an advantage over filtering-based estimation
                  algorithms, which cannot incorporate delayed
                  measurements optimally. We provide an implementation
                  of the general fixed-lag smoothing algorithm using
                  square root smoothing, a technique that has recently
                  become prominent. Square root smoothing uses fast
                  sparse matrix factorization and enables our
                  fixed-lag pose estimation algorithm to run at
                  upwards of 20 Hz. Our algorithm has been extensively
                  tested over hundreds of hours of operation on a
                  robot operating in outdoor environments. We present
                  results based on these tests that verify our claims

  Abstract =	 {An algorithm that achieves complete decentralisation
                  of the Kalman filter algorithm amongst the sensing
                  nodes of a multisensor system is preserved. This
                  algorithm does not require any form of central
                  processing facility or centralised communications
                  medium. Each sensing node implements its own local
                  Kalman filter to arrive at a partial decision which
                  it then broadcasts to every other node. Each node
                  then assimilates this received information to arrive
                  at its own local estimate of the system state. The
                  algorithm guarantees that each local estimate thus
                  obtained is identical to the estimate that would be
                  obtained if a conventional, completely centralised,
                  Kalman filter were used. Because there is no single
                  central processing node the algorithm is highly
                  resilient to loss of one or more sensing nodes. The
                  fully decentralised nature ensures that it is ideal
                  for implementation on a parallel processing array,
                  such as a transputer network. The algorithm has been
                  tested using a simulated multiperson pursuit-evasion
                  game to check the viability. The algorithm has also
                  been implemented on a transputer based array of

  Abstract =	 {We present two algorithms for tracking and
                  identification in decentralized multi-sensor
                  systems. Decentralized architectures have many
                  benefits in terms of modularity, speed and
                  robustness. The state estimation (tracking)
                  algorithm is a decentralized Kalman filter (DKF)
                  based on the extended Kalman filter. Identification
                  is achieved by the decentralized Bayesian
                  identification (DBI) algorithm, which identifies
                  targets being tracked. For each of the algorithms
                  The authors discuss optimality and the effect of
                  reducing connectivity. The structure of the
                  algorithms leads to the development of an
                  architecture for a modular sensing node based on
                  communication considerations. The authors present
                  example implementations of both algorithms on actual
                  transputer-based sensing nodes. They describe RCD
                  (region of constant depth) tracking and for this
                  develop a monopulse sonar arrangement with which
                  they implement real-time autonomous tracking by a
                  single sensor node. The second example
                  implementation describes identification of targets
                  being tracked by the DKF using the DBI on actual CCD
                  camera-based nodes},

  C-Durrantwhyte01Fusion ={Work on decentralised systems began in 1989
                  as part of the ESPRIT project SKIDS. In the SKIDS
                  project, a fully decentralised surveillance system
                  was implemented using four cameras and a Transputer
                  based architecture. The network was a
                  fully-connected point-to-point topology. The system
                  was capable of tracking multiple targets (humans and
                  robots) and addressed such issues as decentralised
                  data association and decentralised
                  identification. The SKIDS demonstrator, which
                  continued to be refined and operated for almost 10
                  years, laid the basis for all subsequent work on
                  decentralised data fusion.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a new sensing modality and
                  stratagem for multirobot exploration. The approach
                  is based on using pairs of robots that observe each
                  other's behavior, acting in concert to reduce
                  odometry errors. We assume the robots can both
                  directly sense nearby obstacles and see each
                  other. This allows the robots to obtain a map of
                  higher accuracy than would be possible with robots
                  acting independently by reducing inaccuracies that
                  occur over time from dead reckoning
                  errors. Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of
                  the robots to see each other, we can detect opaque
                  obstacles in the environment independently of their
                  surface reflectance properties. Two different
                  algorithms, based on the size of the environment,
                  are introduced with a complexity analysis, and
                  experimental results in simulation and with real
                  robots},

  R-Burgard05Tro ={focus on the problem of reducing the odometry error
                  during exploration. They separate the environment
                  into stripes that are explored successively by the
                  robot team. Whenever one robot moves, the other
                  robots are kept stationary and observe the moving
                  robot, a strategy similar to the presented by
                  Kurazume and Shigemi [Kurazume94icra]. Whereas this
                  approach can signicantly reduce the odometry error
                  during the exploration process, it is not designed
                  to distribute the robots over the
                  environment. Rather, the robots are forced to stay
                  close to each other in order to remain in the
                  visibility range.e},

  Abstract =	 {LAMA is a classical planning system based on
                  heuristic forward search. Its core feature is the
                  use of a pseudo-heuristic derived from landmarks,
                  propositional formulas that must be true in every
                  solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the Fast
                  Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather
                  than binary state variables and multi-heuristic
                  search. The latter is employed to combine the
                  landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known
                  FF heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive,
                  focusing on high-quality solutions in the case where
                  actions have non-uniform cost.  A weighted A* search
                  is used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that
                  the planner continues to search for plans of better
                  quality until the search is terminated.  \\ LAMA
                  showed best performance among all planners in the
                  sequential satisficing track of the International
                  Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we present
                  the system in detail and investigate which features
                  of LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present
                  individual results for some of the domains used at
                  the competition, demonstrating good and bad cases
                  for the techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we
                  find that using landmarks improves performance,
                  whereas the incorporation of action costs into the
                  heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial. We
                  show that in some domains a search that ignores cost
                  solves far more problems, raising the question of
                  how to deal with action costs more effectively in
                  the future. The iterated weighted A* search greatly
                  improves results, and shows synergy effects with the
                  use of landmarks.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes the theoretical and practical
                  development of a decentralised air and ground
                  sensing network for target tracking and
                  identification. The theoretical methods employed for
                  studying decentralised data fusion problems are
                  based on the information-filter formulation of the
                  Kalman filter algorithm and on information-theoretic
                  methods derived from the Bayes theorem. The paper
                  particularly focuses on how these methods are
                  applied in very large heterogeneous sensor networks,
                  where there may be a significant amount of data
                  delay or corruption in communication. This paper
                  then describes the development of a practical system
                  aimed at demonstrating some of these principles. The
                  system consists of a number of unmanned air vehicles
                  (UAVs), with radar and vision payloads, able to
                  observe a number of ground targets. The UAV sensor
                  payloads are constructed in a modular fashion, with
                  the ability to communicate in a network with both
                  other air-borne and other ground sensors. The ground
                  sensor system comprises of multiple modular sensing
                  nodes which include vision scanned laser, steerable
                  radar, multiple fixed radar arrays, and combined
                  night vision (IR)-radar.},

                  and conditioning of variables. Typically, given an
                  ordering, it prefers the elimina- tion of a variable
                  whenever possible, and switches to conditioning
                  whenever space limitations require it, and continues
                  in the same manner until all variables have been

  Abstract =	 {We describe the prototype of a system intended to
                  allow a user to navigate in an urban environment
                  using a mobile telephone equipped with a camera. The
                  system uses a database of views of building facades
                  to determine the pose of a query view provided by
                  the user. Our method is based on a novel
                  wide-baseline matching algorithm that can identify
                  corresponding building facades in two views despite
                  significant changes of viewpoint and lighting. We
                  show that our system is capable of localising query
                  views reliably in a large part of Cambridge city
                  centre.},

                  of location and building recognition has been
                  addressed by several authors in the past, mostly
                  considering outdoors scenes. In
                  \cite{Robertson04bmvc} the authors used vertical
                  vanishing direction for alignment of a building view
                  in the query image to the canonical view in the
                  database and proposed matching using point features
                  followed by the relative pose recovery between the
                  views. The alignment step relied on the presence of
                  dominant plane and hence was applicable to scenarios
                  with dominant building facades. The actual
                  triangulation using known GPS locations was not
                  carried out.},

                  results in this paper are related to the study of
                  the following question. Given an $n\times n$
                  positive definite matrix $M$ that is sparse (many
                  zero entries), which of the matrices $PMP^T$ ($P$ an
                  $n\times n$ permutation matrix) should we use to
                  solve a system equivalent to $Mx=b$ by Gaussian
                  elimination? S. V. Parter \cite{Parter61siam}
                  discussed this question when $M$ was represented by
                  a tree, and he showed that an ordering $P$ could be
                  found which resulted in a `perfect' elimination
                  scheme. Our results show this is true more generally
                  when $M$ can be represented by a triangulated
                  graph. We present here only the theoretical aspects
                  of elimination and will present elsewhere the
                  applications of this analysis to the study of
                  efficient numerical solution of sparse positive

                  on sparse symmetric and unsymmetrlc systems of
                  linear equations. We discuss good algorithms for
                  finding elimination orderings, showing that a
                  generalization of breadth-first search, called
                  lexicographlc search, can be used to find perfect
                  orderlngs in O(n+e) time and minimal orderlngs in
                  O(ne) time, if the problem graph is undirected and
                  has n vertices and e edges. We also give efficient
                  (though slower) algorithms for generating such

                  NP-complete, and conjecture that it is also
                  NP-complete for undirected graphs. We include a
                  brief discussion of the relation of elimination to
                  transitive closure and discuss some unresolved, more

                  problems in which additional summands are added to

                  for decentralized state estimation from multiple

                  recognized, centralized architectures impose severe
                  scaling limitations for distributed systems due to
                  the enormous communication overheads. We propose a
                  strictly decentralized approach in which only nearby
                  platforms exchange information. They do so through
                  an interactive communication protocol aimed at
                  maximizing information flow. Our approach is

                  important class of discrete optimization
                  problems. We consider discrete, multivariate,
                  optimization problems in which the objective
                  function is given as a sum of terms. Each term is a
                  function of only a subset of the variables. We first
                  consider a class of optimization algorithms which
                  eliminate suboptimal solutions by comparing the
                  objective function on "comparable" partial
                  solutions. A large, natural subclass of comparison
                  algorithms in which the subproblems considered are
                  either nested or nonadjacent (i.e., noninteracting)

  Abstract =	 {The deployment of human gaze has been almost
                  exclusively studied independent of any specific
                  ongoing task and limited to two-dimensional picture
                  viewing. This contrasts with its use in everyday
                  life, which mostly consists of purposeful tasks
                  where gaze is crucially involved. To better
                  understand deployment of gaze under such
                  circumstances, we devised a series of experiments,
                  in which subjects navigated along a walkway in a
                  virtual environment and executed combinations of
                  approach and avoidance tasks. The position of the
                  body and the gaze were monitored during the
                  execution of the task combinations and dependence of
                  gaze on the ongoing tasks as well as the visual
                  features of the scene was analyzed. Gaze
                  distributions were compared to a random gaze
                  allocation strategy as well as a specific ?aliency
                  model.?Gaze distributions showed high similarity
                  across subjects. Moreover, the precise fixation
                  locations on the objects depended on the ongoing
                  task to the point that the specific tasks could be
                  predicted from the subject? fixation data. By
                  contrast, gaze allocation according to a random or a
                  saliency model did not predict the executed
                  fixations or the observed dependence of fixation
                  locations on the specific task.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a new approach to the problem of
                  simultaneously localizing a group of mobile robots
                  capable of sensing each other. Each of the robots
                  collects sensor data regarding its own motion and
                  shares this information with the rest of the team
                  during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the
                  form of a Kalman filter, processes the available
                  positioning information from all the members of the
                  team and produces a pose estimate for each of
                  them. The equations for this centralized estimator
                  can be written in a decentralized form thus allowing
                  this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a
                  number of smaller communicating filters, each of
                  them processing local data for most of the time. The
                  resulting decentralized estimation scheme
                  constitutes a unique mean for fusing measurements
                  collected from a variety of sensors with minimal
                  communication and processing requirements. The
                  distributed localization algorithm is applied to a
                  group of 3 robots and the improvement in
                  localization accuracy is presented. Finally, a
                  comparison to the equivalent distributed information
                  filter is provided},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we present an information-based
                  approach to solve the SLAM problem using stereo
                  vision. This approach results for an improvement, in
                  terms of both efficiency and robustness, of our
                  early multi-view ICP randomized algorithm. Instead
                  of minimizing an ICP-based cost, we propose the
                  minimization of the entropy of the 2D distribution
                  induced by the projection of the 3D point cloud. In
                  addition we embed both the egomotion/action
                  estimation algorithm which precedes global
                  rectification and the new global rectification
                  algorithm in an autonomous exploration schema. We
                  assume plane-parallel environments and, for the sake
                  of efficiency, we also assume a flat floor and a
                  fixed stereo camera mounted on the robot. We show
                  successful experiments both under tele-operating the
                  robot and under autonomous navigation.},

  Abstract =	 {Recent work in the object recognition community has
                  yielded a class of interest-point-based features
                  that are stable under significant changes in scale,
                  viewpoint, and illumination, making them ideally
                  suited to landmark-based navigation. Although many
                  such features may be visible in a given view of the
                  robot? environment, only a few such features are
                  necessary to estimate the robot? position and
                  orientation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of automatically selecting, from the entire set of
                  features visible in the robot? environment, the
                  minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
                  navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose
                  the world into a small number of maximally sized
                  regions, such that at each position in a given
                  region, the same small set of features is
                  visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
                  formulation of the problem, and prove that it is
                  NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of
                  approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the
                  decompositions from the real image data to measure
                  the localization performance versus the undecomposed
                  map.},

  Abstract =	 {Shadows are integral parts of natural scenes and one
                  of the elements contributing to nat- uralness of
                  synthetic scenes. In many image analysis and
                  interpretation applications, shadows interfere with
                  fundamental tasks such as object extraction and
                  description. For this reason, shadow segmentation is
                  an important step in image analysis. In this paper,
                  we propose a new cast shadow segmentation algorithm
                  for both still and moving images. The proposed
                  technique exploits spectral and geometrical
                  properties of shadows in a scene to perform this
                  task. The presence of a shadow is first hypothesized
                  with an initial and simple evidence based on the
                  fact that shadows darken the surface which they are
                  cast upon. The validity of detected regions as
                  shadows is further verified by making use of more
                  complex hypotheses on color invariance and geometric
                  properties of shadows. Finally, an information
                  integration stage confirms or rejects the initial
                  hypothesis for every detected region. Simulation
                  results show that the proposed algorithm is robust
                  and efficient in detecting shadows for a large class
                  of scenes.},

                  they came from approximately same location. The

                  substantial overlap between the views. The GPS
                  coordinates were not available, hence the location
                  triangulation stage was not considered.},

  Abstract =	 {The paper presents a new method for matching
                  individual line segments between images. The method
                  uses both grey-level information and the multiple
                  view geometric relations between the images. For
                  image pairs epipolar geometry facilitates the
                  computation of a cross-correlation based matching
                  score for putative line correspondences. For image
                  triplets cross-correlation matching scores are used
                  in conjunction with line transfer based on the
                  trifocal geometry. Algorithms are developed for both
                  short and long range motion. In the case of long
                  range motion the algorithm involves evaluating a one
                  parameter family of plane induced homographies. The
                  algorithms are robust to deficiencies in the line
                  segment extraction and partial
                  occlusion. Experimental results are given for image
                  pairs and triplets, for varying motions between
                  views, and for different scene types. The three view
                  algorithm eliminates all mismatches},

                  these relations can be, e.g., movement decisions

                  invariance of these features to image translation,
                  scaling and rotation makes them suitable landmarks

  Abstract =	 {We consider the problem of creating a consistent
                  alignment of multiple 3D submaps containing
                  distinctive visual landmarks in an unmodified
                  environment. An efficient map alignment algorithm
                  based on landmark specificity is proposed to align
                  submaps. This is followed by a global minimization
                  using the close-theloop constraint. Landmark
                  uncertainty is taken into account in the pair-wise
                  alignment and the global minimization
                  process. Experiments show that pair-wise alignment
                  of submaps with backward correction produces a
                  consistent global 3D map. Our vision-based mapping
                  approach using sparse 3D data is different from
                  other existing approaches which use dense 2D range
                  data from laser or sonar rangefinders.},

                  started. Submaps are aligned pair-wise or
                  incrementally, where the latter one allows detection
                  of loop-closures. If a loop-closure is detected, the

                  minimizing the overall error over previously

                  solving a linear equation system. An extension

  Abstract =	 {We have previously developed a mobile robot system
                  which uses scale-invariant visual landmarks to
                  localize and simultaneously build three-dimensional
                  (3-D) maps of unmodified environments. In this
                  paper, we examine global localization, where the
                  robot localizes itself globally, without any prior
                  location estimate. This is achieved by matching
                  distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to
                  a database map. A Hough transform approach and a
                  RANSAC approach for global localization are
                  compared, showing that RANSAC is much more efficient
                  for matching specific features, but much worse for
                  matching nonspecific features. Moreover, robust
                  global localization can be achieved by matching a
                  small submap of the local region built from multiple
                  frames. This submap alignment algorithm for global
                  localization can be applied to map building, which
                  can be regarded as alignment of multiple 3-D
                  submaps. A global minimization procedure is carried
                  out using the loop closure constraint to avoid the
                  effects of slippage and drift accumulation. Landmark
                  uncertainty is taken into account in the submap
                  alignment and the global minimization
                  process. Experiments show that global localization
                  can be achieved accurately using the scale-invariant
                  landmarks. Our approach of pairwise submap alignment
                  with backward correction in a consistent manner
                  produces a better global 3-D map.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a novel background subtraction
                  method for detecting foreground objects in dynamic
                  scenes involving swaying trees and fluttering
                  flags. Most methods proposed so far adjust the
                  permissible range of the background image variations
                  according to the training samples of background
                  images. Thus, the detection sensitivity decreases at
                  those pixels having wide permissible ranges. If we
                  can narrow the ranges by analyzing input images, the
                  detection sensitivity can be improved. For this
                  narrowing, we employ the property that image
                  variations at neighboring image blocks have strong
                  correlation, also known as cooccurrence. This
                  approach is essentially different from chronological

                  postprocessing. Experimental results for real images

                  a reinterpretation of Dempster's work, a
                  reinterpretation that identifies his "lower
                  probabilities" as epistemic probabilities or degrees
                  of belief, takes the rule for combining such degrees
                  of belief as fundamental, and abandons the idea that
                  they arise as lower bounds over classes of Bayesian

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we give a simple account of local
                  computation of marginal probabilities for when the
                  joint probability distribution is given in factored
                  form and the sets of variables involved in the
                  factors form a hypertree. Previous expositions of
                  such local computation have emphasized conditional
                  probability. We believe this emphasis is
                  misplaced. What is essential to local computation is
                  a factorization. It is not essential that this
                  factorization be interpreted in terms of conditional
                  probabilities. The account given here avoids the
                  divisions required by conditional probabilities and
                  generalizes readily to alternative measures of
                  subjective probability, such Dempster-Shafer or

  Abstract =	 {Investigates the use of Euclidean invariant features
                  in a generalization of iterative closest point (ICP)
                  registration of range images. Pointwise
                  correspondences are chosen as the closest point with
                  respect to a weighted linear combination of
                  positional and feature distances. It is shown that,
                  under ideal noise-free conditions, correspondences
                  formed using this distance function are correct more
                  often than correspondences formed using the
                  positional distance alone. In addition, monotonic
                  convergence to at least a local minimum is shown to
                  hold for this method. When noise is present, a
                  method that automatically sets the optimal relative
                  contribution of features and positions is
                  described. This method trades off the error in
                  feature values due to noise against the error in
                  positions due to misalignment. Experimental results
                  suggest that using invariant features decreases the
                  probability of being trapped in a local minimum and
                  may be an effective solution for difficult range
                  image registration problems where the scene is very
                  small compared to the model},

  Abstract =	 {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable
                  Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful
                  tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are
                  particularly useful for representing the topology of
                  environments such as road networks and office
                  buildings, which are typical for robot navigation
                  and planning. The work presented here describes a
                  formal framework for incorporating readily available
                  odometric information and geometrical constraints
                  into both the models and the algorithm that learns
                  them. By taking advantage of such information,
                  learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better
                  solutions and require fewer iterations, while being
                  robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental
                  results, obtained from both simulated and real robot
                  data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the

  Abstract =	 {Topological maps provide a useful abstraction for
                  robotic navigation and planning. Although stochastic
                  maps can theoretically be learned using the
                  Baum-Welch algorithm, without strong prior
                  constraint on the structure of the model it is slow
                  to converge, requires a great deal of data, and is
                  often stuck in local minima. In this paper, we
                  consider a special case of hidden Markov models for
                  robot-navigation environments, in which states are
                  associated with points in a metric configuration
                  space. We assume that the robot has some odometric
                  ability to measure relative transformations between
                  its configurations. Such odometry is typically not
                  precise enough to suffice for building a global map,
                  but it does give valuable local information about
                  relations between adjacent states. We present an
                  extension of the Baum-Welch algorithm that takes
                  advantage of this local odometric information,
                  yielding faster convergence to better solutions with

  Abstract =	 {The highly task-specific fixation patterns revealed
                  in performance of natural tasks demonstrate the
                  fundamentally active nature of vision, and suggest
                  that in many situations, top-down processes may be a
                  major factor in the acquisition of visual
                  information. Understanding how a top-down visual
                  system could function requires understanding the
                  mechanisms that control the initiation of the
                  different task-specific computations at the
                  appropriate time. This is particularly difficult in
                  dynamic environments, like driving, where many
                  aspects of the visual input may be unpredictable. We
                  therefore examined drivers?ability to detect Stop
                  signs in a virtual environment when the signs were
                  visible for restricted periods of time. Detection
                  performance is heavily modulated both by the
                  instructions and the local visual context. This
                  suggests that visibility of the signs requires
                  active search, and that the frequency of this search
                  is influenced by learnt knowledge of the
                  probabilistic structure of the environment.},

                  suggest that an orientation-specific representation
                  is formed (J. J. Rieser, 1989). Five experiments are
                  reported that together with existing studies,
                  suggest that orientation-free performance requires a
                  conjunction of study-test conditions, including a
                  "horizontal" viewing angle during encoding, a
                  room-sized test space, and "on-path" testing. If any

                  orientation-specific performance was observed at
                  test. The findings support a multiple-view model of

                  that constructs 3D models from a collection of
                  panoramic image mosaics. A panoramic mosaic consists
                  of a set of images taken around the same viewpoint,
                  and a transformation matrix associated with each
                  input image. Our system first recovers the camera
                  pose for each mosaic from known line directions and
                  points, and then constructs the 3D model using all
                  available geometrical constraints. We partition
                  constraints into soft and hard linear constraints so
                  that the modeling process can be formulated as a
                  linearlyconstrained least-squares problem, which can
                  be solved efficiently using QR factorization. The

  Abstract =	 {This paper deals with automatically learning the
                  spatial distribution of a set of images. That is,
                  given a sequence of images acquired from
                  well-separated locations, how can they be arranged
                  to best explain their genesis? The solution to this
                  problem can be viewed as an instance of robot
                  mapping although it can also be used in other
                  contexts. We examine the problem where only limited
                  prior odometric information is available, employing
                  a feature-based method derived from a probabilistic
                  pose estimation framework. Initially, a set of
                  visual features is selected from the images and
                  correspondences are found across the ensemble. The
                  images are then localized by first assembling the
                  small subset of images for which odometric
                  confidence is high, and sequentially inserting the
                  remaining images, localizing each against the
                  previous estimates, and taking advantage of any
                  priors that are available. We present experimental
                  results validating the approach, and demonstrating
                  metrically and topologically accurate results over
                  two large image ensembles. Finally, we discuss the
                  results, their relationship to the autonomous
                  exploration of an unknown environment, and their
                  utility for robot localization and navigation.},

                  using the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter
                  (RBPF). We focus on the class of indoor mobile
                  robots equipped with only a stereo vision
                  sensor. Our goal is to construct dense metric maps
                  of natural 3D point landmarks for large cyclic
                  environments in the absence of accurate landmark
                  position measurements and reliable motion
                  estimates. Landmark estimates are derived from
                  stereo vision and motion estimates are based on
                  visual odometry. We distinguish between landmarks
                  using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform
                  (SIFT). Our work defers from current popular
                  approaches that rely on reliable motion models
                  derived from odometric hardware and accurate
                  landmark measurements obtained with laser
                  sensors. We present results that show that our model
                  is a successful approach for vision-based SLAM, even
                  in large environments. We validate our approach
                  experimentally, producing the largest and most
                  accurate vision-based map to date, while we identify
                  the areas where future research should focus in

  Abstract =	 {With recent advances in real-time implementations of
                  filters for solving the simultaneous localization
                  and mapping (SLAM) problem in the range-sensing
                  domain, attention has shifted to implementing SLAM
                  solutions using vision-based sensing. This paper
                  presents and analyses different models of the
                  Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) for
                  vision-based SLAM within a comprehensive application
                  architecture. The main contributions of our work are
                  the introduction of a new robot motion model
                  utilizing structure from motion (SFM) methods and a
                  novel mixture proposal distribution that combines
                  local and global pose estimation. In addition, we
                  compare these under a wide variety of operating
                  modalities, including monocular sensing and the
                  standard odometry-based methods. We also present a
                  detailed study of the RBPF for SLAM, addressing
                  issues in achieving real-time, robust and
                  numerically reliable filter behavior. Finally, we
                  present experimental results illustrating the
                  improved accuracy of our proposed models and the
                  efficiency and scalability of our implementation.},

  Abstract =	 {The use of line features in real-time visual
                  tracking applications is commonplace when a prior
                  map is available, but building the map while
                  tracking in real-time is much more difficult. We
                  describe how straight lines can be added to a
                  monocular Extended Kalman Filter Simultaneous
                  Mapping and Localisation (EKF SLAM) system in a
                  manner that is both fast and which integrates easily
                  with point features. To achieve real-time operation,
                  we present a fast straight-line detector that
                  hypothesises and tests straight lines connecting
                  detected seed points. We demonstrate that the
                  resulting system provides good camera localisation
                  and mapping in real-time on a standard workstation,
                  using either line features alone, or lines and
                  points combined.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, we describe a representation for
                  spatial information, called the stochastic map, and
                  associated procedures for building it, reading
                  information from it, and revising it incrementally
                  as new information is obtained. The map contains the
                  estimates of relationships among objects in the map,
                  and their uncertainties, given all the available
                  information. The procedures provide a general
                  solution to the problem of estimating uncertain
                  relative spatial relationships. The estimates are
                  probabilistic in nature, an advance over the
                  previous, very conservative, worst-case approaches
                  to the problem. Finally, the procedures are
                  developed in the context of state-estimation and
                  filtering theory, which provides a solid basis for
                  numerous extensions.},

  R-Durrantwhyte06Ram ={This paper showed that as a mobile robot moves
                  through an unknown environment taking relative
                  observations of landmarks, the estimates of these
                  landmarks are all necessarily correlated with each
                  other because of the common error in estimated
                  vehicle location [27]. The implication of this was
                  profound: A consistent full solution to the combined
                  localisation and mapping problem would require a
                  joint state composed of the vehicle pose and every
                  landmark position, to be updated following each
                  landmark observation. In turn, this would require
                  the estimator to employ a huge state vector (of
                  order the number of landmarks maintained in the map)
                  with computation scaling as the square of the number
                  of landmarks.},

                  photographs of a scene using a novel 3D
                  interface. Our system consists of an image-based
                  modeling front end, which automatically computes the
                  viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D
                  model of the scene and image to model
                  correspondences. Our photo navigation tool uses
                  imagebased rendering techniques to smoothly
                  transition between photographs, while also enabling
                  full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of
                  images and world geometry, along with auxiliary
                  information such as overhead maps. Our system also
                  makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or

                  details, which are automatically transferred to

  Abstract =	 {Visual SLAM is, in recent years, a very active
                  research area, the result of activities in the
                  convergence of the robotics and computer vision
                  communities. We present an overview of techniques,
                  from classical filtering to bundle adjustment
                  solutions, for both monocular and stereo (or
                  multicamera) systems, and emphasize that classical
                  SLAM solutions have been discarding precious sensory
                  information. In particular, the ability of vision to
                  sense objects at infinity should be exploited at its
                  maximum because it is precisely these remote objects
                  that will provide long-term, stable angular
                  references (in the way a compass would
                  do). Monocular SLAM systems have already solved this
                  issue, but stereo and multicamera systems have
                  not. We propose in these cases to use monocular SLAM
                  algorithms using fusion to incorporate all the
                  information. Numerous advantages like
                  desynchronization of the sensors firing, the
                  possibility of using several unequal cameras, or
                  selfcalibration, will naturally arise. We develop a
                  particular method for extrinsically decalibrated
                  stereo systems to illustrate the proposed ideas. We
                  evaluate the method with a real indoor experiment,
                  and highlight and discuss both its assets and
                  drawbacks.},

  Abstract =	 {Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest
                  that there is a tight link between eye movements and
                  goal directed motor actions. However, most existing
                  models of human eye movements provide a bottom up
                  account that relates visual attention to attributes
                  of the visual scene. The purpose of this paper is to
                  introduce a new model of human eye movements that
                  directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands
                  of behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements
                  serve to reduce uncertainty about environmental
                  variables that are task relevant. A value is
                  assigned to an eye movement by estimating the
                  expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if
                  the movement is not made. If there are several
                  candidate eye movements, the one with the highest
                  expected value is chosen. The model is illustrated
                  using a humanoid graphic figure that navigates on a
                  sidewalk in a virtual urban environment. Simulations
                  show our protocol is superior to a simple round
                  robin scheduling mechanism.},

  Abstract =	 {The photorealistic modeling of large-scale scenes,
                  such as urban structures, requires a fusion of range
                  sensing technology and traditional digital
                  photography. This paper presents a system that
                  integrates automated 3D-to-3D and 2D-to-3D
                  registration techniques, with multiview geometry for
                  the photorealistic modeling of urban scenes. The 3D
                  range scans are registered using our automated
                  3D-to-3D registration method that matches 3D
                  features (linear or circular) in the range images. A
                  subset of the 2D photographs are then aligned with
                  the 3D model using our automated 2D-to-3D
                  registration algorithm that matches linear features
                  between the range scans and the
                  photographs. Finally, the 2D photographs are used to
                  generate a second 3D model of the scene that
                  consists of a sparse 3D point cloud, produced by
                  applying a multiview geometry
                  (structure-from-motion) algorithm directly on a
                  sequence of 2D photographs. The last part of this
                  paper introduces a novel algorithm for automatically
                  recovering the rotation, scale, and translation that
                  best aligns the dense and sparse models. This
                  alignment is necessary to enable the photographs to
                  be optimally texture mapped onto the dense
                  model. The contribution of this work is that it
                  merges the benefits of multiview geometry with
                  automated registration of 3D range scans to produce
                  photorealistic models with minimal human
                  interaction. We present results from experiments in
                  large-scale urban scenes.},

  Abstract =	 {Humanoid robotics and SLAM (Simultaneous
                  Localisation and Mapping) are certainly two of the
                  most significant themes of the current worldwide
                  robotics research effort, bu tthe two fields have up
                  until now largely run independent parallel paths,
                  despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining
                  the two. The next major step forward in humanoid
                  robotics will be increased autonomy, and the ability
                  of a robot to create its own world map on the fly
                  will be a significant enabling
                  technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found
                  most success with robot platforms and sensor
                  configurations which are outside of the humanoid
                  domain. Humanoid robots move with high linear and
                  angular accelarations in full 3D, and normally only
                  vision is available as an outward-looking
                  sensor. Building on recently published work on
                  monocular SLAM using vision, and on pattern
                  generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a
                  humanoid can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we
                  present results in which a sparse 3D map of visual
                  landmarks is acquired on the fly using a single
                  camera and deonstrated loop closing and drift-free
                  3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered
                  indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly
                  coupling the pattern generator, the robot odometry
                  and inertial sensing to aid visual mapping within a
                  standard EKF framework. To our knowledge this is the
                  first implementation of real-time 3D SLAM for a
                  humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing.},

  Abstract =	 { A common method for real-time segmentation of
                  moving regions in image sequences involves back-
                  ground subtraction, or thresholding the error
                  between an estimate of the image without moving
                  objects and the current image. The numerous
                  approaches to this problem differ in the type of
                  background model used and the procedure used to
                  update the model. This paper discusses modeling each
                  pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and using an on-line
                  approximation to update the model. The Gaussian
                  distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
                  evaluated to determine which are most likely to
                  result from a background process. Each pixel is
                  classified based on whether the Gaussian
                  distribution which represents it most effectively is
                  considered part of the background model. This
                  results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which
                  reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive
                  motions from clutter, and long-term scene
                  changes. This system has been run almost
                  continuously for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through

  R-Thrun03Isrr ={If two robots discover similar maps, are they
                  actually in the same environment, or are these two
                  different parts of the environment that look alike?
                  Clearly, this question is trivially answered if the
                  robots start at the same location. If their initial
                  location is unknown it creates a challenging data
                  association problem. This problem was addressed is a
                  recent paper [this]: the idea here is that robots
                  continuously attempt to localize themselves in each
                  other's maps using particle filters. While this is a
                  highly promising approach, it is computationally
                  somewhat expensive, due to the high costs of running
                  K2 particle filters for K robots.},

  Abstract =	 {The objective of the autonomous navigation and
                  sensing experiment research (ANSER) project is to
                  demonstrate decentralized data fusion (DDF) and
                  simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM)
                  across multiple uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs). To
                  achieve this objective, the project specifies the
                  development of four UAVs, where each UAV houses up
                  to two terrain sensors and an INS/GPS navigation
                  system. The terrain sensors include a scanning
                  radar, laser/vision and standard vision system. The
                  DDF concept has to be shown to be effective both on
                  a single UAV and on multiple UAVs. The proof of the
                  concept will lie in the ability of the DDF structure
                  to conduct multi-target tracking problems as well as
                  SLAM. To obtain this goal, a number of subgoals are
                  required, most of which have never been attempted
                  before on a research level. The objective of this
                  paper is to present these goals as an overview of
                  the ANSER project along with some simulated and
                  real-time results.},

                  w.r.t. different layers) ,motion, shape, and
                  apperance over time. In their filtering step, they
                  deterministically update motion & shape parameters

                  ownerships and appearance pixel values with other

                  a generalized EM where each variables are updated

                  approach is that the step of computing the
                  pixel-ownership (masking) is rather limited to
                  certain simple shapes since their algorithm is not
                  very general, as pointed out by Jojic01cvpr. And

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a new global matching framework
                  for stereo computation. In this framework, the
                  second view is first predicted from the reference
                  view using the depth information. A global match
                  measure is then defined as the similarity function
                  between the predicted image and the actual
                  image. Stereo computation is converted into a search
                  problem where the goal is to find the depth map that
                  maximizes the global match measure. The major
                  advantage of this framework is that the global
                  visibility constraint is inherently enforced in the
                  computation. This paper explores several key
                  components of this framework including (1) three
                  color segmentation based depth representations, (2)
                  an incremental warping algorithm that dramatically
                  reduces the computational complexity, and (3) scene
                  constraints such as the smoothness constraint and
                  the color similarity constraint. Experimental
                  results using different types of depth
                  representations are presented. The quality of the
                  computed depth maps is demonstrated through
                  image-based rendering from new viewpoints},

                  an arbitrary vertex v \in V for which it sets a(v) =

  Abstract =	 {The final goal for many visual surveillance systems
                  is automatic understanding of events in a
                  site. Higher level processing on video data requires
                  certain lower level vision tasks to be
                  performed. One of these tasks is the segmentation of
                  video data into regions that correspond to objects
                  in the scene. Issues such as automation, noise
                  robustness, adaptation, and accuracy of the model
                  must be addressed. Current background modeling
                  techniques use heuristics to build a representation
                  of the background, while it would be desirable to
                  obtain the background model automatically. In order
                  to increase the accuracy of modeling it needs to
                  adapt to different parts of the same scene and
                  finally the model has to be robust to noise. The
                  building block of the model representation used in
                  this paper is multivariate non-parametric kernel
                  density estimation which builds a statistical model
                  for the background of the video scene based on the
                  probability density function of its pixels. A post
                  processing step is applied to the background model
                  to achieve the spatial consistency of the foreground
                  objects. },

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a scheme which takes as input a
                  3D point cloud and an associated color image and
                  parses the scene into a collection of salient planar
                  surfaces. The scheme makes use of a fast color
                  segmentation scheme to divide the color image into
                  coherent regions and the groupings suggested by this
                  procedure are used to inform and accelerate a RANSAC
                  based interpretation process. Results on real data
                  sets are presented.},

                  game theoretic one. There are three different knid
                  of specifications one are guarantee properties, this
                  means that guarantee properties with certain state
                  of F at least ones or set of states. The complement
                  to it are safety properties, which should prevent
                  visiting certain states at all and the thrird type
                  of properties is reccurence properties which should
                  guarantee that certain state will be visited
                  infinitely often. If the specification is specifies
                  as a logical formula the reactive program can be
                  synthetized in three steps. Firts the formula is
                  translated to deterministic omega-automaton, then
                  this automaton is transformed into a game graph,
                  from which the winning strategy and its
                  implementation by a reactive program is
                  constructed. First and third step are difficult and
                  better synthesis algorithms and complexity bounds

  Abstract =	 {We present an efficient probabilistic algorithm for
                  the concurrent mapping and localization problem that
                  arises in mobile robotics. The algorithm addresses
                  the problem in which a team of robots builds a map
                  online, while simultaneously accommodating errors in
                  their odometry. At the core of the algorithm is a
                  technique that combines fast maximum likelihood map
                  growing with a Monte Carlo localizer that uses
                  particle representations. The combination of both
                  yields an online algorithm that can cope with large
                  odometric errors typically found when mapping
                  environments with cycles. The algorithm can be
                  implemented distributedly on multiple robot
                  platforms, enabling a team of robots to
                  cooperatively generate a single map of their
                  environment. Finally, an extension is described for
                  acquiring three-dimensional maps, which capture the
                  structure and visual appearance of indoor
                  environments in 3D.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the
                  simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM)
                  problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a
                  static environment with a mobile robot. The vast
                  majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates
                  an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the
                  extended information filter (EIF). We show that when
                  represented in the information form, map posteriors
                  are dominated by a small number of links that tie
                  together nearby features in the map. This insight is
                  developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called
                  the sparse extended information filters
                  (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks
                  of features that are locally interconnected, where
                  links represent relative information between pairs
                  of nearby features, as well as information about the
                  robot? pose relative to the map. We show that all
                  essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed
                  in constant time, irrespective of the size of the
                  map. We also provide empirical results obtained for
                  a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor
                  environment, and using a multi-robot mapping

  Abstract =	 {Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two
                  major paradigms for mapping indoor environments:
                  grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods
                  produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often
                  prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in
                  large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps,
                  on the other hand, can be used much more
                  efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological
                  maps are considerably difficult to learn in
                  large-scale environments. This paper describes an
                  approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based
                  and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using
                  artificial neural networks and Bayesian
                  integration. Topological maps are generated on top
                  of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter
                  into coherent regions. By combining both
                  paradigms?rid-based and topological? the approach
                  presented here gains the best of both worlds:
                  accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives
                  results for autonomously operating a mobile robot
                  equipped with sonar sensors in populated multi-room

  Abstract =	 {The problem of concurrent mapping and localization
                  has received considerable attention in the mobile
                  robotics community. Existing approaches can largely
                  be grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological
                  and metric. This paper proposes a method that
                  integrates both. It poses the mapping problem as a
                  statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises
                  an efficient algorithm for search in likelihood
                  space. It presents an novel mapping algorithm that
                  integrates two phases: a topological and a metric
                  mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves
                  a global position alignment problem between
                  potentially indistinguishable, significant
                  places. The subsequent metric mapping phase produces
                  a fine-grained metric map of the environment in
                  floating-point resolution. The approach is
                  demonstrated empirically to scale up to large,
                  cyclic, and highly ambiguous environments.},

  Abstract =	 {Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain
                  models of their environments. Research on mobile
                  robot navigation has produced two major paradigms
                  for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and
                  topological. While grid-based methods produce
                  accurate metric maps, their complexity often
                  prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in
                  large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps,
                  on the other hand, can be used much more
                  efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological
                  maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in
                  large-scale environments, particularly if momentary
                  sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper
                  describes an approach that integrates both
                  paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based
                  maps are learned using artificial neural networks
                  and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are
                  generated on top of the grid-based maps, by
                  partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By
                  combining both paradigms, the approach presented
                  here gains advantages from both worlds:
                  accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives
                  results for autonomous exploration, mapping and
                  operation of a mobile robot in populated multi-room
                  environments.},

  Abstract =	 {To operate successfully in indoor environments,
                  mobile robots must be able to localize
                  themselves. Most current localization algorithms
                  lack flexibility, autonomy, and often optimality,
                  since they rely on a human to determine what aspects
                  of the sensor data to use in localization (e.g.,
                  what landmarks to use). This paper describes a
                  learning algorithm, called BaLL, that enables mobile
                  robots to learn what features/landmarks are best
                  suited for localization, and also to train
                  artificial neural networks for extracting them from
                  the sensor data. A rigorous Bayesian analysis of
                  probabilistic localization is presented, which
                  produces a rational argument for evaluating
                  features, for selecting them optimally, and for
                  training the networks that approximate the optimal
                  solution. In a systematic experimental study, BaLL
                  outperforms two other recent approaches to mobile

  Abstract =	 {We present a new method to robustly and efficiently
                  analyze foreground when we detect background for a
                  fixed camera view by using mixture of Gaussians
                  models and multiple cues. The background is modeled
                  by three Gaussian mixtures as in the work of
                  Stauffer and Grimson. Then the intensity and texture
                  information are integrated to remove shadows and to
                  enable the algorithm working for quick lighting
                  changes. For foreground analysis, the same Gaussian
                  mixture model is employed to detect the static
                  foreground regions without using any tracking or
                  motion information. Then the whole static regions
                  are pushed back to the background model to avoid a
                  common problem in background subtraction -
                  fragmentation (one object becomes multiple
                  parts). The method was tested on our real time video

  Abstract =	 {Field-of-view (FOV) restrictions are known to affect
                  human behaviour and to degrade performance for a
                  range of different tasks. However, the relationship
                  between human locomotion performance in complex
                  environments and FOV size is currently not fully
                  known. This paper examined the effects of FOV
                  restrictions on the performance of participants
                  manoeuvring through an obstacle course with
                  horizontal and vertical barriers. All FOV
                  restrictions tested (the horizontal FOV was either
                  30? 75?or 120? while the vertical FOV was always 48?
                  significantly reduced performance compared to the
                  unrestricted condition. Both the time and the number
                  of footsteps needed to traverse the entire obstacle
                  course increased with a decreasing FOV size. The
                  relationship between FOV restriction and manoeuvring
                  performance that was determined can be used to
                  formulate requirements for FOV restricting devices

                  localization and mapping (SLAM) using monocular
                  vision based on the structure-from-motion scheme. An
                  crucial issue in applying structure-from-motion to
                  SLAM is that accuracy depends heavily on the
                  baseline distance. We address this problem by
                  selecting an appropriate baseline based on criteria
                  for the tradeoff between the baseline distance and
                  the number of feature points visible in the
                  images. Experimental results show that full 3-D

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a method of 3-D SLAM using a
                  single camera. We utilize a Rao-Blackwellised
                  particle filter (RBPF) to deal with a large number
                  of landmarks. A difficulty in monocular SLAM is
                  robustness to outliers and noise, which may cause
                  false estimates especially under short baseline
                  conditions. We propose an exhaustive pose-space
                  search that finds all the plausible hypotheses
                  efficiently using epipolar geometry. The obtained
                  pose hypotheses are refined by the RBPF. Simulations
                  and experiments show that the proposed method

  Abstract =	 {Service robots designed for domestic settings need
                  to navigate in an environment that they have to
                  share with their users. Thus, they have to be able
                  to report their current state and whereabouts in a
                  way that is comprehensible for the user. Pure metric
                  maps do not usually correspond to the understanding
                  of the environment a user would provide. Thus, the
                  robotic map needs to be integrated with the human
                  representation. This paper describes our framework
                  of Human Augmented Mapping that allows us to achieve
                  this integration.We propose further a method to
                  specify and represent regions that relate to a user?
                  view on the environment. We assume an interactive
                  setup for the specification of regions and show the

                  distinctiveness for space segmentation and in terms

  Abstract =	 {Human interaction with a service robot requires a

                  dialogue and task specification where names used for
                  particular locations are depending on personal
                  preferences. A question is how such human oriented
                  models can be tied to the geometric robotic models
                  needed for precise localisation and navigation. We
                  assume that this integration can be based on the
                  information potential users give to a service robot
                  about its working environment. We further believe
                  that this information is best given in an
                  interactive setting (a "guided tour") in this
                  particular environment. This paper presents a pilot

  Abstract =	 {Background maintenance is a frequent element of
                  video surveillance systems. We develop Wallflower, a
                  three-component system for background maintenance:
                  the pixel-level component performs Wiener filtering
                  to make probabilistic predictions of the expected
                  background; the region-level component fills in
                  homogeneous regions of foreground objects; and the
                  frame-level component detects sudden, global changes
                  in the image and swaps in better approximations of
                  the background. We compare our system with 8 other
                  background subtraction algorithms. Wallflower is
                  shown to outperform previous algorithms by handling
                  a greater set of the difficult situations that can
                  occur. Finally, we analyze the experimental results
                  and propose normative principles for background

  Abstract =	 {Recently, the acquisition of three-dimensional maps
                  has become more and more popular. This is motivated
                  by the fact that robots act in the three-dimensional
                  world and several tasks such as path planning or
                  localizing objects can be carried out more reliable
                  using three-dimensional representations.  In this
                  paper we consider the problem of extracting planes
                  from three-dimensional range data. In contrast to
                  previous approaches our algorithm uses a
                  hierarchical variant of the popular Expectation
                  Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously learn
                  the main directions of the planar structures. These
                  main directions are then used to correct the
                  position and orientation of planes. In practical
                  experiments carried out with real data and in
                  simulations we demonstrate that our algorithm can
                  accurately extract planes and their orientation from
                  range data.},

  C-Sangmin =	 {They used hierarchical Markov chain with finish
                  variables, used by Murphy and Paskin. The overall
                  learning of H-CRF is quite impressive given that
                  there can be a huge number of parameters. In terms
                  of experimental results, the results are good. But,
                  the models have only two and three layers where the
                  number of states are quite small (total number of
                  meta states would be less than 20). For problems
                  with large number of states at every hierarchy, it
                  is not clear what is the computational complexity
                  w.r.t. the number of states, maybe the the quadratic
                  w.r.t. the total number of concatenated meta
                  states. The more severe aspect is that the inference
                  complexity is O(T^3). Basically, for long sequences,
                  the algorithm would face severe computational
                  challenge. This complexity is also related to Bui's
                  AAAI paper on HHMM with general hierarchy. Maybe
                  there would be a room to improve the efficiency.},

  Abstract =	 {Our mobile robot, Spinoza, embodies a sophisticated
                  real-time vision system for the control of a mobile
                  robot in a dynamic environment. The complexity of
                  our robot architecture arises from the wide variety
                  of tasks that need to be performed and the resulting
                  challenge of coordinating multiple distributed,
                  concurrent processes on a diverse range of processor
                  architectures, including transputers, digital signal
                  processors and a workstation host. The system
                  handles the sensing, reasoning and action components
                  of a robot, distributed over these architectures,
                  and responds to unpredictable events in an unknown
                  dynamic environment. Spinoza relies heavily on its
                  capability to perform real-time vision processing in
                  order to perform task such as mapping, navigation,
                  exploration, tracking and simple manipulation.},

  R-Mathscinet = {This condensed paper consists of two parts: a
                  discussion of methods for solving linear algebraic
                  equations and a discussion of the errors to be
                  expected. In the first part the author states that
                  methods of approximation are more laborious than
                  direct ones. Concerning the direct methods he shows
                  that most of them are applications of the
                  decomposition of the matrix $A$ into the product
                  $LDU$, where $L$ and $U$ are triangular matrices
                  with diagonal elements 1 and having elements not
                  equal to zero below or above the diagonal,
                  respectively, and $D$ is a diagonal matrix. He
                  proves that the decomposition is
                  unique. Applications of this are Gauss's elimination
                  method with the Jordan variant which the author
                  considers the best method for inverting $A$,
                  Choleski's method, Morris's escalator process and
                  Schmidt's orthogonalization. For each of these
                  methods the author measures the work of computation
                  by counting the number of multiplications and

  Abstract =	 {This paper examines the processing of visual
                  information beyond the creation of the early
                  represcntations. A fundamental requirement at this
                  level is the capacity to establish visually abstract
                  shape properties and spatial relations. This
                  capacity plays a major role in object recognition,
                  visually guided manipulation, and more abstract
                  visual thinking. For the human visual system, the
                  perception of spatial properties and relations that
                  are complex from a computational standpoint,
                  nevertheless often appears immediate and
                  effortless. This apparent immediateness and ease of
                  perceiving spatial relations is, however,
                  deceiving. It conceals in fact a complex array of
                  processes highly specialized for the task. The
                  proficiency of the human system in analyzing spalial
                  information far surpasses the capacities of current
                  artificial systems. The study of the computations
                  that underlie this competence may therefore lead to
                  the development of new more efficient processors for
                  the spatial analysis of visual information. It is
                  suggested that the perception of spatial relations
                  is achieved by the application to the base
                  representations of visual routines that are composed
                  of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for
                  different properties and relations share elemental
                  operations. Using a fixed set of basic operations,
                  the visual system can assemble different routines to
                  extract an unbounded variety of shape properties and
                  spatial relations. At a more detailed level, a
                  number of plausible basic operations are suggested,
                  based primarily on their potential usefulness, and
                  supported in part by empirical evidence. The
                  operations discussed include shifting of the
                  processing focus, indexing to an odd-man-out
                  location, bounded activation, boundary tracing, and
                  marking. The problem of assembling such elemental
                  operations into meaningful visual routines is
                  discussed briefly.},

                  perception of spatial relationships, such as the
                  apparently effortless perceptual process of judging
                  whether a point is inside a closed curve. The
                  essential property of a routine was that it
                  instantiated a procedure as opposed to requiring a
                  specialized detector of some kind. For example,
                  seeing if two points are on the same contour can be
                  done using an operation such as tracing the
                  contour. A procedure such as this can cope with a

                  spatial relations divides the analysis of visual
                  information into 2 main stages: the bottom-up
                  creation of certain representations of the visible
                  environment and the application of visual routines,

                  2 1/2 or primary sketch. The application of visual
                  routines is not botom up anymore and representations
                  are created to meet specific computational
                  goals. Visual routines can be viewed as elementary
                  operations or their combinations (either parallel or
                  sequential comb.) Examples of elementary visual
                  routines are : 1. Shift of the processing or focus
                  (just apply particular operation to some
                  region). 2. Indexing (the region to which the
                  operation will be applied is indexed by some
                  distinctive feature). 3. Bouded activation
                  (operation is applied over surface or boundary
                  stopping at discontinuities). 4. Boundary tracing
                  (tracing a single contour or number of contours)
                  5. Marking (operation of marking a location - means
                  location was remembered and the processsing can

                  Rosencrantz's work, there is no guarantee of a

                  then transmitted to neighbouring platforms. The net
                  result was that each platform locally maintained a

                  all nodes in the network.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents an algorithm that builds
                  topological maps, using omnidirectional vision as
                  the only sensor modality. Local features are
                  extracted from images obtained in sequence, and are
                  used both to cluster the images into nodes and to
                  detect links between the nodes. The algorithm is
                  incremental, reducing the computational requirements
                  of the corresponding batch algorithm. Experimental
                  results in a complex, indoor environment show that
                  the algorithm produces topologically correct maps,
                  closing loops without suffering from perceptual
                  aliasing or false links. Robustness to lighting
                  variations was further demonstrated by building
                  correct maps from combined multiple datasets
                  collected over a period of 2 months.},

  Abstract =	 {Robots are rapidly evolving from factory workhorses
                  to robot-companions. The future of robots, as our
                  companions, is highly dependent on their abilities
                  to understand, interpret and represent the
                  environment in an efficient and consistent fashion,
                  in a way that is comprehensible to humans. This
                  paper is oriented in this direction. It suggests a
                  hierarchical probabilistic representation of space
                  that is based on objects. A global topological
                  representation of places with object graphs serving
                  as local maps is suggested. Experiments on place
                  classification and place recognition are also
                  reported in order to demonstrate the applicability
                  of such a representation in the context of
                  understanding space and thereby performing spatial
                  cognition. Further, relevant results from user
                  studies validating the proposed representation are
                  also reported. Thus the theme of the work is
                  representation for spatial cognition.},

  Abstract =	 {Geometric representations of the environment play an
                  important role in mobile robotics as they support
                  various tasks such as motion control and accurate
                  localization. Popular approaches to represent the
                  geometric features of an environment are occupancy
                  grids or line models. Whereas occupancy grids
                  require a huge amount of memory and therefore do not
                  scale well with the size of the environment, line
                  models are unable to correctly represent corners or
                  connections between objects. In this paper we
                  present an algorithm that learns sets of polylines
                  from laser range scans. Starting with an initial set
                  of polylines generated from the range scans it
                  iteratively optimizes these polylines using the
                  Bayesian Information Criterion. During the
                  optimization process our algorithm utilizes
                  information about the angles between line segments
                  extracted from the original range scans. We present
                  experiments illustrating that our algorithm is able
                  to learn accurate and highly compact polyline maps
                  from laser range data obtained with mobile robots.},

                  very practical, highly engineered towards the

                  measure the auto-regressive model correlation length
                  through thorough result analysis. It looks quite
                  principled, and should be used in my work

  Abstract =	 {Spatial navigation in the presence of gravity
                  restricts one's displacement to two-dimensional (2D)
                  planes. Therefore, self-motion only includes
                  translations and yaw rotations. In contrast, in
                  weightlessness, one can translate and turn in any
                  direction. In the first experiment, we compared the
                  ability to memorize a virtual three-dimensional (3D)
                  maze after passive exploration in three self-motion
                  conditions, each using a different set of rotations
                  for turning. Subjects indicated which pathway they
                  traversed among four successive corridors presented
                  from an outside perspective. Results showed that
                  exploring in the terrestrial condition (including
                  only yaw rotations, the viewer's virtual body
                  remaining upright) allowed better recognition of the
                  corridor than in the weightless condition (which
                  included pitch and yaw rotations according to the
                  turns), particularly for more complex 3D
                  structures. The more frequently the viewer-defined
                  (egocentric) and the global environment
                  (allocentric) verticals were aligned during
                  exploration, the more easily subjects could memorize
                  the 3D maze, suggesting that simplifying the
                  relationship between the egocentric and allocentric
                  reference frames facilitates spatial
                  updating. Nevertheless, with practice, performance
                  in the weightless condition improved whereas in the
                  natural terrestrial condition performance remained
                  at its initial maximum, indicating that the
                  cognitive processes involved were innate for this
                  particular condition. The second experiment revealed
                  that single rotations in the terrestrial condition
                  must be performed around the body axis in order to
                  obtain optimal spatial updating performance, and
                  that the latter is independent of the conflict with
                  gravity that might favor this condition when one is
                  actually upright. This suggests that although humans
                  can memorize 3D-structured environments their innate
                  neurocognitive functions appear to be specialized
                  for natural 2D navigation.},

                  2D mazes. In 3D mazes, performance improved when the
                  human remained oriented "upwards", suggesting that
                  spatial updating is easier when the egocentric and

                  different augmented reality applications. The
                  ARToolKitPlus searches for rectangular markers in
                  the images and uses basic computer vision techniques
                  to efficiently find the four corners of the
                  markers. Knowing the location of four points on a
                  planar surface is enough to use homography and find
                  the relative pose of the marker with respect to the
                  camera. ARToolKitPlus provides the capability of
                  syntheisizing hundreds of Id-based fiducial markers

  Abstract =	 {We propose that visual adaptation in orientation,
                  spatial frequency, and motion can be understood from
                  the perspective of optimal information
                  transmission. The essence of the proposal is that
                  neural response properties at the system level
                  should be adjusted to the changing statistics of the
                  input so as to maximize information transmission. We
                  show that this principle accounts for several
                  well-documented psychophysical phenomena, including
                  the tilt aftereffect, change in contrast sensitivity
                  and post-adaptation changes in orientation
                  discrimination. Adaptation can also be considered on
                  a longer time scale, in the context of tailoring
                  response properties to natural scene
                  statistics. From the anisotropic distribution of
                  power in natural scenes, the proposal also predicts
                  differences in the contrast sensitivity function
                  across spatial frequency and orientation, including
                  the oblique effect.},

  Abstract =	 {D-SLAM algorithm first described in [1] allows SLAM
                  to be decoupled into solving a non-linear static
                  estimation problem for mapping and a
                  three-dimensional estimation problem for
                  localization. This paper presents a new version of
                  the D-SLAM algorithm that uses an absolute map
                  instead of a relative map as presented in [1]. One
                  of the significant advantages of D-SLAM algorithm is
                  its O(N) computational cost where N is the total
                  number of features (landmarks). The theoretical
                  foundations of D-SLAM together with implementation
                  issues including data association, state recovery,
                  and computational complexity are addressed in
                  detail. Evaluation of the D-SLAM algorithm is
                  provided using both real experimental data and

  Abstract =	 {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for SLAM
                  that makes use of a state vector consisting of
                  quantities that describes the relative locations
                  among features. In contrast to previous relative map
                  strategies, the new state vector is compact and
                  always consists of 2n-3 elements (in a 2-D
                  environment) where n is the number of features in
                  the map. It is also shown that the information from
                  observations can be transformed and grouped into two
                  parts: first one containing the information about
                  the map and the second one containing the
                  information about the robot location relative to the
                  features in the map. Therefore the SLAM can be
                  decoupled into two processes where mapping uses the
                  first part of the transformed observation vector and
                  localization becomes a 3-dimensional estimation
                  problem. It is also shown that the information
                  matrix of the map is exactly sparse, resulting in
                  potential computational savings when an information
                  filter is used for mapping. The new decoupled SLAM
                  algorithm is called D-SLAM and is illustrated using
                  simulation. },

  Abstract =	 {The main contribution of this paper is the
                  reformulation of the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) problem for mobile robots such that
                  the mapping and localization can be treated as two
                  concurrent yet separated processes: DSLAM (decoupled
                  SLAM). It is shown that SLAM can be decoupled into
                  solving a nonlinear static estimation problem for
                  mapping and a lowdimensional dynamic estimation
                  problem for localization. The mapping problem can be
                  solved using an Extended Information Filter where
                  the information matrix is shown to be exactly
                  sparse. A significant saving in the computational
                  effort can be achieved for large scale problems by
                  exploiting the special properties of sparse
                  matrices. An important feature of DSLAM is that the
                  correlation among landmarks are still kept and it is
                  demonstrated that the uncertainty of the map
                  landmarks monotonically decrease. The algorithm is
                  illustrated through computer simulations and

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we present a prototype system for
                  image based localization in urban
                  environments. Given a database of views of city
                  street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system
                  computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We
                  first use a wide-baseline matching technique based
                  on SIFT features to select the closest views in the
                  database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint
                  and presence of repetitive structures, a large
                  percentage of matches (> 50\%) are not correct
                  correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation
                  between the query view and the reference view, is
                  then handled by a novel and efficient robust
                  estimation technique capable of dealing with large
                  percentage of outliers. This stage is also
                  accompanied by a model selection step among the
                  fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the
                  motion between the closest reference views is
                  estimated, the location of the query view is then
                  obtained by triangulation of translation
                  directions. Approximate solutions for cases when
                  triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also
                  described. The presented system is tested on the
                  dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest

                  computationally efficient three-dimensional (3-D)
                  object segmentation technique. The technique is
                  based on the detection of edges in the image. The
                  edges can be classified as belonging to one of the
                  three categories: fold edges, semistep edges
                  (defined here), and secondary edges. The 3-D image
                  is sliced to create equidepth contours (EDCs). Three
                  types of critical points are extracted from the
                  EDCs. A subset of the edge pixels is extracted first
                  using these critical points. The edges are grown
                  from these pixels through the application of some
                  masks proposed in this correspondence. The
                  constraints of the masks can be adjusted depending
                  on the noise present in the image. The total
                  computational effort is small since the masks are
                  applied only over a small neighborhood of critical
                  points (edge regions). Furthermore, the algorithm
                  can be implemented in parallel, as edge growing from

  Abstract =	 {Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable
                  alternative for constructing high performance coding
                  systems. In particular, the recent success of turbo
                  codes indicates that performance close to the
                  Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is
                  showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are
                  special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum
                  and sum-product algorithms, which also include
                  non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decod-
                  ing. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are
                  developed and presented as generalized trellis
                  algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is
                  replaced by an arbitrary graph, the "Tanner
                  graph". With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting
                  decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are
                  maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially
                  increasing com- plexity. Iterative decoding occurs
                  when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo
                  codes); the resulting algorithms are in general
                  suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions
                  are possible compared to the cycle-free
                  case. Several performance estimates for iterative
                  decod- ing are developed, including a generalization
                  of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a
                  characterization of errors that are uncorrectable
                  after infinitely many decoding itera-tions.},

  Abstract =	 {Eye-movements have long been considered a problem
                  when trying to understand the visual control of
                  locomotion. They transform the retinal image from a
                  simple expanding pattern of moving texture elements
                  (pure optic flow), into a complex combination of
                  translation and rotation components (retinal
                  flow). In this article we investigate whether there
                  are measurable advantages to having an active free
                  gaze, over a static gaze or tracking gaze, when
                  steering along a winding path. We also examine
                  patterns of free gaze behavior to determine
                  preferred gaze strategies during active
                  locomotion. Participants were asked to steer along a
                  computer-simulated textured roadway with free gaze,
                  fixed gaze, or gaze tracking the center of the
                  roadway. Deviation of position from the center of
                  the road was recorded along with their point of
                  gaze. It was found that visually tracking the middle
                  of the road produced smaller steering errors than
                  for fixed gaze. Participants performed best at the
                  steering task when allowed to sample naturally from
                  the road ahead with free gaze. There was some
                  variation in the gaze strategies used, but sampling
                  was predominantly of areas proximal to the center of
                  the road. These results diverge from traditional
                  models of flow analysis.},

                  ensuring that the FoE always lies in the required
                  direction. .. Owls have large eyes, which are highly
                  sensitive to environmental motion, and are fixed in
                  their sockets. .. Nearly all animals with good

                  mobile gaze is an essential feature of visual data

                  the vehicle control architecture currently running
                  on the Oberon submersible. This architecture is
                  based on the Distributed Architecture for Mobile
                  Navigation. We use a distributed, decoupled control
                  paradigm to facilitate the tuning of individual
                  control modes. A number of behaviours have been
                  created to direct the motion of the vehicle. We show
                  that when coupled with a low-level terrain-aided
                  navigation scheme, effective control of the vehicle
                  can be achieved.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a new technique for the simultaneous
                  registration of multiple corresponding point sets
                  with rigid 3D transformations. This class of
                  problems is a generalization of the classic pairwise
                  point set registration task, involving multiple
                  views with multiple correspondences existing between
                  them. The proposed technique requires the
                  computation of a constant matrix which encodes the
                  point correspondence information, followed by an
                  efficient iterative algorithm to compute the optimal
                  rotations. The optimal translations are then
                  recovered directly through the solution of a linear
                  equation system. The algorithm supports weighting of
                  data according to confidence, and we show how it may
                  be incorporated into two robust estimation
                  frameworks to detect and reject outlier data. We
                  have integrated our method into a generalized
                  multiview ICP surface matching system and tested it
                  with synthetic and real data. These tests indicate
                  that the technique is accurate and efficient. The
                  algorithm also compares favorably to another
                  multiview technique from the literature.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents a novel approach to the
                  multi-vehicle Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
                  (SLAM) problem that exploits the manner in which
                  observations are fused into the global map of the
                  environment to manage the computatidnal complexity
                  of the algorithm and improve the data association
                  process. Rather than incorporating every observation
                  directly into the global map of the environment, the
                  Constrained Local Submap Filter (CLSF) relies on
                  creating an independent, local submap of the
                  features in the immediate vicinity of the
                  vehicle. This local submap is then periodically
                  fused into the global map of the environment. This
                  representation has been shown to reduce the
                  computational complexity of maintaining the global
                  map estimates as well as improving the data
                  association process. This paper examines the
                  prospect of applying the CLSF algorithm to the

  Abstract =	 {Monocular SLAM has the potential to turn inexpensive
                  cameras into powerful pose sensors for applications
                  such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
                  current implementations lack the robustness required
                  to be useful outside laboratory conditions: blur,
                  sudden motion and occlusion all cause tracking to
                  fail and corrupt the map. Here we present a system
                  which automatically detects and recovers from
                  tracking failure while preserving map integrity. By
                  extending recent advances in keypoint recognition
                  the system can quickly resume tracking ?i.e. within
                  a single frame time of 33ms ?using any of the
                  features previously stored in the map. Extensive
                  tests show that the system can reliably generate
                  maps for long sequences even in the presence of
                  frequent tracking failure.},

                  visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping)
                  system after tracking failure. The monocular SLAM
                  system stores the 3D locations of visual landmarks,
                  together with a local image patch. When the system
                  becomes lost, candidate matches are obtained using
                  correlation, then the pose of the camera is solved
                  via an efficient implementation of RANSAC using a
                  three-point-pose algorithm. We demonstrate the
                  usefulness of this method within visual SLAM: (i) we
                  show tracking can reliably resume after tracking
                  failure due to occlusions, motion blur or unmodelled
                  rapid motions; (ii) we show how the method can be
                  used as an adjunct for a proposal distribution in a
                  particle filter framework; (iii) during successful
                  tracking we use idle cycles to test if the current
                  map overlaps with a previouslybuilt map, and we
                  provide a solution to aligning the two maps by
                  splicing the camera trajectories in a consistent and

The study suggests that the brain uses optical flow to do this updating, using an egocentric map. (However, other studies suggest that humans use allocentric maps to remember the positions of objects for longer periods of time). This study also suggests that some brain regions only update object positions when the updated positions are needed, in this case for pointing at them. (This would be evidence of an allocentric map - the object locations are not actually updated during movement if they are not observed - their computed egocentric positions can then be computed as needed from the allocentric map).},

                  reliably on thousands of people in many different

                  misunderstood as part of moving objects in change
                  detection based video segmentation, this paper
                  proposes a novel approach to the cast shadow
                  detection based on the edge and region information
                  in multiple frames. First, an initial change
                  detection mask containing moving objects and cast
                  shadows is obtained. Then a Canny edge map is
                  generated. After that, the shadow region is detected
                  and removed through multiframe integration, edge
                  matching, and region growing. Finally, a post
                  processing procedure is used to eliminate noise and
                  tune the boundaries of the objects. Our approach can
                  be used for video segmentation in indoor
                  environment. The experimental results demonstrate
                  its good performance.},

	Abstract = {Background modeling is important for video
                  surveillance. In the paper, we present a novel
                  background modeling algorithm based on probabilistic
                  graphic model and Gibbs Sampling. The background is
                  modeled at different resolution level by image
                  pyramids. We develop a time dependent pyramidal
                  Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent the state of
                  foreground/background at each pixel in the
                  pyramid. Both spatial and temporal constraints in
                  the foreground labeling process are considered using
                  three kinds of links in the MRF. The probability of
                  adding/deleting a foreground object is calculated by
                  online learning algorithm and is used as prior
                  information in computing foreground label. We use
                  Gibbs Sampling to solve the MRF under the framework
                  of Maximum A Posterior (MAP). Experimental result
                  shows that this real-time algorithm is able to
                  segment the foreground object accurately from videos

	Abstract = {We describe an approach to recognizing location from
                  mobile devices using image-based Web search. We
                  demonstrate the usefulness of common image search
                  metrics applied on images captured with a
                  camera-equipped mobile device to find matching
                  images on the World Wide Web or other
                  general-purpose databases. Searching the entire Web
                  can be computationally overwhelming, so we devise a
                  hybrid image-and-keyword searching technique. First,
                  image-search is performed over images and links to
                  their source Web pages in a database that indexes
                  only a small fraction of the Web. Then, relevant
                  keywords on these Web pages are automatically
                  identified and submitted to an existing text-based
                  search engine (e.g. Google) that indexes a much
                  larger portion of the Web. Finally, the resulting
                  image set is filtered to retain images close to the
                  original query. It is thus possible to efficiently
                  search hundreds of millions of images that are not
                  only textually related but also visually
                  relevant. We demonstrate our approach on an
                  application allowing users to browse Web pages
                  matching the image of a nearby location.},

@techreport{Zhang01tr,
	Abstract = {We propose a new incremental motion estimation
                  algorithm to deal with long image sequences. It
                  applies to a sliding window of triplets of images,
                  but unlike previous approaches, which rely on point
                  matches across three or more views, we also use
                  those points shared only by two views. This is
                  important because matches between two views are more
                  common than those across more views. The problem is
                  formulated as a series of local bundle adjustments
                  in such a way that the estimated camera motions in
                  the whole sequence are consistent with each
                  other. Two implementations are described. The first
                  is an exact one, which, based on the observation of
                  the sparse structure of the adjustment network,
                  embeds the optimization of 3D structure parameters
                  within the optimization of the camera pose
                  parameters. This optimization embedding considerably
                  reduces the minimization complexity. The second is a
                  mathematical procedure which transforms the original
                  problem involving both 3D structure and pose
                  parameters into a much smaller one, a minimization
                  over just the camera? pose parameters. This leads to
                  an even higher computational gain. Because we make

@article{Zhang09pami,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for recovering
                  consistent depth maps from a video sequence. We
                  propose a bundle optimization framework to address
                  the major difficulties in stereo reconstruction,
                  such as dealing with image noise, occlusions, and
                  outliers. Different from the typical multi-view
                  stereo methods, our approach not only imposes the
                  photo-consistency constraint, but also explicitly
                  associates the geometric coherence with multiple
                  frames in a statistical way. It thus can naturally
                  maintain the temporal coherence of the recovered
                  dense depth maps without over-smoothing. To make the
                  inference tractable, we introduce an iterative
                  optimization scheme by first initializing the
                  disparity maps using a segmentation prior and then
                  refining the disparities by means of bundle
                  optimization. Instead of defining the visibility
                  parameters, our method implicitly models the
                  reconstruction noise as well as the probabilistic
                  visibility. After bundle optimization, we introduce
                  an efficient space-time fusion algorithm to further
                  reduce the reconstruction noise. Our automatic depth
                  recovery is evaluated using a variety of challenging
                  video examples.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes information-based approaches to
                  processing and organizing spatially distributed,
                  multimodal sensor data in a sensor
                  network. Energy-constrained networked sensing
                  systems must rely on collaborative signal and
                  information processing (CSIP) to dynamically
                  allocate resources, maintain multiple sensing foci,
                  and attend to new stimuli of interest, all based on
                  task requirements and resource constraints. Target
                  tracking is an essential capability for sensor
                  networks and is used as a canonical problem for
                  studying information organization problems in
                  CSIP. After formulating a CSIP tracking problem in a
                  distributed constrained optimization framework, the
                  paper describes information-driven sensor query and
                  other techniques for tracking individual targets as
                  well as combinatorial tracking problems such as
                  counting targets. Results from simulations and
                  experimental implementations have demonstrated that
                  these information-based approaches are scalable and
                  make efficient use of scarce sensing and

                  mobile robots navigating in indoor

                  realized via the combination of the stereo vision
                  and laser-activated RFID based on the principle of
                  triangulation. The localization system functions
                  like an indoor GPS. Preliminary research shows that

	Abstract = {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for
                  robots and wearable systems such that localization
                  accuracies of centimeters can be obtained for
                  hundreds of meters of distance traveled. Existing
                  systems have achieved approximately a 1\% to 5\%
                  localization error rate whereas our proposed system
                  achieves close to 0.1\% error rate, a ten-fold
                  reduction. Traditional visual odometry systems drift
                  over time as the frame-to-frame errors
                  accumulate. In this paper, we propose to improve
                  visual odometry using visual landmarks in the
                  scene. First, a dynamic local landmark tracking
                  technique is proposed to track a set of local
                  landmarks across image frames and select an optimal
                  set of tracked local landmarks for pose
                  computation. As a result, the error associated with
                  each pose computation is minimized to reduce the
                  drift significantly. Second, a global landmark based
                  drift correction technique is proposed to recognize
                  previously visited locations and use them to correct
                  drift accumulated during motion. At each visited
                  location along the route, a set of distinctive
                  visual landmarks is automatically extracted and
                  inserted into a landmark database dynamically. We
                  integrate the landmark based approach into a
                  navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a low-cost
                  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased
                  robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual
                  odometry system using local and global landmarks can
                  precisely locate a user within 1 meter over 1000
                  meters in unknown indoor/outdoor environments with
                  challenging situations such as climbing stairs,
                  opening doors, moving foreground objects etc..},

	C-Richard = {This paper deals with jointly estimating optical flow and image segmentation. They model the optical flow in each image segment as affine, and include image similarity terms for the purpose of segmentation. This is interesting because they use multiple "physical" models (the affine flow models) to explain parts of the image, jointly inferring which model instantiations explain which parts of the image. They are leveraging top-down knowledge of the types of flow patterns that are observed, and what image properties (i.e. appearance similarity) tend to indicate that an image region is contiguous. To use our language, the segmentation acts as data association, determining which image regions are explained by each instantiation of an affine flow model. In turn, the affine flow model is a physical model, that results from the assumption of objects moving rigidly in the scene, or motion of the camera.},

                  re-considered. Instead of emphasising formal
                  operations on abstract symbols the new approach
                  foregrounds the fact that cognition is rather a
                  situated activity and suggests that thinking beings
                  ought therefore be considered first and foremost as
                  acting beings. The essay reviews recent work in
                  embodied cognition, provides a concise guide to its
                  principles attitudes and goals and identifies the
                  physical grounding projects as its central research

                  \cite{barnard02}\cite{barnard03}\cite{barnard01a}\cite{barnard01}:
                  It is very important to mention the work of Barnard
                  et. al. in the context of automated annotation of
                  images and scene representation. \cite{barnard02}
                  won the the best paper award in Cognitive Vision at
                  ECCV 2002. The goal of their work is to attach words
                  (annotations) to images and image regions. The
                  specialty is that they learn the joint statistics of
                  words and image regions from annotated training
                  images. After having learned the models, words can
                  be attached to images outside the training set
                  (auto-annotation). The work of Barnard et. al. is
                  based on methods for modeling co-occurrence data,
                  especially the work of Hofmann and Puzicha
                  \cite{hofmann98a}. They developed a flat and
                  hierarchical models for dyadic (co-occurrence) data,
                  that is data that has associations of different
                  types (e.g. image features and image annotations).},

	Annote = {The ability to find one's way depends on neural
                  algorithms that integrate information about place,
                  distance and direction, but the implementation of
                  these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly
                  understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial
                  entorhinal cortex {dMEC} contains directionally
                  oriented, topographically organised neural map of
                  the spatial environment. Its key unit is the "grid
                  cell" which is activated whenever the animal's
                  position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid
                  of equilateral trriangles spanning the surface of
                  the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a
                  common orientation and spacing, but their certex
                  locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and
                  size of individual fields increase from dorsal to
                  central dMEC. The map is anchored to external
                  lanndmarks but persists in their absence, suggesting
                  the grid cells might be part ofa generalised path

	Abstract = {Since Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approaches
                  reached a prime of importance in interactive robot
                  programming, sensor technology for tracking the
                  user's actions and behavior is attached more and
                  more importance. However, traditional methods based
                  on single sensor system input are already at their
                  limits, since PbD is an application area where
                  real-time requirement do play an important
                  role. Thus, a sensor fusion approach is proposed
                  which serves input data for a finite state
                  automat. The input sources are on the one hand a
                  data-glove which classifies different grips and on
                  the other hand a movable camera head which tracks
                  the movements of the data glove as well as estimates
                  object positions. Both sensor sources use time
                  efficient algorithms, since sensory data must be
                  processed in real-time. The efficiency of this
                  approach is proven in a PbD environment were
                  flexible infusion bags are handled and respective
                  actions and object positions are recognized.},

                  comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing
                  different numbers of objects. Second, a Bayesian
                  multi-object filter which uses the abovementioned
                  multi-blob likelihood function as the observation
                  model. Using the standard machinery of particle
                  filters, this results in a filter which is able to
                  track an unknown and varying number of objects. the

	Abstract = {This paper presents our recently developed approach
                  to constructing a hierarchical representation of
                  visual input that aims to enable recognition and
                  detection of a large number of object
                  categories. Inspired by the principles of efficient
                  indexing, robust matching, and ideas of
                  compositionality, our approach learns a hierarchy of
                  spatially flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an
                  unsupervised, statistics-driven manner. Starting
                  with simple, frequent features, we learn the
                  statistically most significant compositions (parts
                  composed of parts), which consequently define the
                  next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer
                  after layer, optimally adjusting to the visual
                  data. Lower layers are learned in a
                  category-independent way to obtain complex, yet
                  sharable visual building blocks, which is a crucial
                  step towards a scalable representation. Higher
                  layers of the hierarchy, on the other hand, are
                  constructed by using specific categories, achieving
                  a category representation with a small number of
                  highly generalizable parts that gained their
                  structural flexibility through composition within
                  the hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can
                  be efficiently and continuously added to the system
                  by adding a small number of parts only in the higher
                  layers. The approach is demonstrated on a large
                  collection of images and a variety of object
                  categories.},

                  original Condensation algorithm
                  \cite{isard:98:a}. Using partitioned sampling can
                  effectively reduce the computational demands for a
                  given problem. In principle, partitioned sampling is
                  a statistical analogy \emph{hierarchical
                  search}. Articulated objects are therefore suitable
                  in particular for this kind of (multi-)object
                  tracker. Besides partitioned sampling, the paper
                  introduces the notion of \emph{survival diagnostics}
                  and \emph{survival rate}. Both quantities can be
                  used for assessing the efficacy of a particle
                  filter. Survival diagnostic --
                  a.k.a. \emph{effective sample set size}
                  \cite{doucet:02:a} -- measures the effective sample
                  set size which has to be within the boundaries of 1
                  (one sample has weight 1 all others have weight 0)
                  and $n$ (all samples have equal weight $1/n$). The
                  survival rate is a property of a given sample set
                  meassuring the over-all tracking performance. More
                  technical details about partitioned sampling for

                  interactive robot programing. This paper outlines a

                  the one hand a data glove which will classify
                  several gestures and grasps and on the other hand a

                  The goal of this research is semantic scene
                  categorization for CBIR. Through a set of
                  psychophysical experiments the authors identify two
                  main axis of human categorization: human
                  vs. non-human and natural vs. man-made. From these
                  main axis, after more experiments, a set of 20 scene
                  categories that seem consistent to the subjects
                  evolve. The subjects are asked to find attributes
                  and semantic descriptors for each of those
                  categories. In a next step these semantic features
                  (e.g. "busy scene") are translated to
                  image-processing features (e.g. "high spatial
                  frequencies"). The image-processing features are
                  used to automatically classify unseen scenes into
                  the semantic categories. The results are mainly
                  qualitatively, but quite interesting. Unfortunately,
                  the paper hasn't been published officially yet. I

                  \cite{oliva01}\cite{oliva02}\cite{torralba01a}\cite{torralba03a}:
                  The work by Oliva and Torralba is based
                  psychophysically on the PhD work of Aude Oliva
                  \cite{oliva00}\cite{schyns94}. Even when viewing
                  scenes only for a very short time period, humans are
                  able to extract enough visual information to
                  accurately recognize its categorical properties. The
                  authors thus use the discrete Fourier transform
                  (DFT) and the windowed DFT in order to describe and
                  to learn the spatial properties of certain scene
                  categories. In \cite{oliva01}, they learn the
                  degrees of naturalness, of openness, of roughness,
                  of expansion and of ruggedness (spatial envelope
                  properties) in order to sort unseen images along
                  these axes. In \cite{torralba01a}, the DFT and the
                  windowed DFT are used to determine the global depth
                  of a scene without absolute depth measurements. In
                  general, the goal of the authors' work is to
                  generate scene-centered descriptions from the
                  spatial envelope properties

	Abstract = {In this paper, the design of an office-guide robot
                  for social interaction studies is presented. We are
                  interested in studying the impact of passage
                  behaviours in casual encounters. While the system
                  offers assistance in locating the appropriate office
                  that a visitor wants to reach, it is expected to
                  engage in a passing behaviour to allow free passage
                  for other persons that it may encounter. Through use
                  of such an approach it is possible to study the
                  effect of social interaction in a situation that is
                  much more natural than out-of-context user
                  studies. The system has been tested in an early
                  evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7
                  hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were
                  registered and 13 passage behaviors were performed
                  to conclude that this framework can be successfully
                  used for the evaluationof passing behaviors in
                  natural contexts of operation. },

	Abstract = {Casual encounters with mobile robots for non-
                  experts can be a challenge due to lack of an
                  interaction model. The present work is based on the
                  rules from proxemics which are used to design a
                  passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral
                  distance of passage is a key parameter to
                  consider. An implemented system has been used in a
                  small study to verify the basic parametric design
                  for such a system. In total 10 subjects evaluated
                  variations in proxemics for encounters with a robot
                  in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates
                  that entering the intimate sphere of people is less
                  comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is
                  also considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of
                  avoidance is a behaviour that must be carefully
                  tuned. },

@article{sala06:_landm,
	Abstract = {Recent work in the object recognition community has
                  yielded a class of interest-point-based features
                  that are stable under significant changes in scale,
                  viewpoint, and illumination, making them ideally
                  suited to landmark-based navigation. Although many
                  such features may be visible in a given view of the
                  robot's environment, only a few such features are
                  necessary to estimate the robot's position and
                  orientation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of automatically selecting, from the entire set of
                  features visible in the robot's environment, the
                  minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
                  navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose
                  the world into a small number of maximally sized
                  regions, such that at each position in a given
                  region, the same small set of features is
                  visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
                  formulation of the problem, and prove that it is
                  NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of
                  approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the
                  decompositions from the real image data to measure
                  the localization performance versus the undecomposed
                  map.},

	Annote = {Detailed description how one can fuse multiple
                  modalities using Bayesian networks. In contrast to
                  classical cue fusion approaches using a voting
                  approach, continuous Bayesian modality fusion (CBMF)
                  combines multiple cues by reasoning about the
                  individual cue's reliability. Continuous global
                  evidence-based Bayesian modality fusion has four
                  main advantages: 1) Continuous sampling reflects the
                  complexity of Bayesian inference most
                  appropriately. 2) Using global evidence allows to
                  consider all observations from a single modality for
                  inference. Most voting approaches take only a single
                  observation per modality into consideration. 3)
                  Bayesian inference allows to introduce new evidence
                  one by one. This provides the ability to distinguish
                  between mandatory modalities required for object
                  tracking and optional modalities which give only
                  further hints about the presence of an
                  object. Furthermore, the nature of Bayesian modality
                  fusion allows to implement on-demand computation for
                  computationally expensive modalities that are only
                  computet selectively for disambiguating ambigous

                  agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity. The
                  intercorrelations among the four measures were low,
                  suggesting that they are indices of different
                  attributes of the pictures. The concepts were
                  selected to provide exemplars from several widely
                  studied semantic categories. Sources of naming
                  variance, and mean familiarity and complexity of the
                  exemplars, differed significantly across the set of
                  categories investigated. The potential significance
                  of each of the normative variables to a number of
                  semantic and episodic memory tasks is discussed.},

	Annote = {This paper proposes an efficient sampling algorithm
                  (SMC) for tracking multiple objects. There are two
                  major contribution: The modeling of multiple objects
                  as object stacks or configurations and the
                  hierarchical sampling scheme for such
                  configurations. Configurations in the sense of this
                  paper are collections of model parameters for
                  multiple object. On one side, this allows to model
                  not only the behaviour of individual objects,
                  e.g. motion but also the behaviour of object groups,
                  in particular addition and deletion of objects. On
                  the other side, stacking multiple objects together
                  increases the problem search space exponentially. In
                  order to overcome the severe computational problems
                  arising from the increased search space, the paper
                  introduces a hierarchical sampling algorithm. In
                  principle, the configurations are broken into
                  sub-configurations according to a subdivison of the
                  image in non-overlapping regions. This smaller
                  sub-configurations are than localy sampled before
                  reassigned to global configurations and propagated
                  globally.},

                  the superordinate, basic, and subordinate level in
                  the categorization of scenes. Their goal is to build
                  a taxonomy for scene categories and to identify the
                  basic or preferred level of categorization for
                  scenes. They carry out a set of psychophysical
                  experiments which result in a taxonomy of
                  environmental scenes. Their research indicates that
                  knowledge about scenes has a hierarchical
                  organization with an intermediate or \emph{basic}
                  level. In addition, the experiments reveal

                  experiments with human subjects. The subjects are
                  asked to sort a set of images into meaningful
                  categories. The evaluation of these categories led
                  to a hierarchical organization of 11 categories. The
                  authors simplify this hierarchy into multiple binary
                  classifications: indoor vs. outdoor, outdoor into
                  city vs. landscape, landscape into sunset
                  vs. mountain/forest, mountain/forest into mountain
                  vs. forest. For the classification they employ a
                  Bayesian framework and vector quantization. In this
                  work, the authors implement only the city
                  vs. landscape classification and landscape into

                  coherence, and color coherence, they reach
                  classification rates from 75\% to 93\% depending on

                  this paper for a monocular camera system mounted on
                  an underactuated wheeled mobile robot (WMR) subject
                  to nonholonomic motion constraints (i.e., the
                  camera-in-hand problem). A prerecorded image
                  sequence (e.g., a video) of three target points is
                  used to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By
                  comparing the target points from a stationary
                  reference image with the corresponding target points
                  in the live image and the prerecorded sequence of
                  images, projective geometric relationships are
                  exploited to construct Euclidean homographies. The
                  information obtained by decomposing the Euclidean
                  homography is used to develop a kinematic
                  controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to
                  develop an adaptive update law to actively
                  compensate for the lack of depth information
                  required for the translation error

@article{wijesoma06:_towar_multid_assig_data_assoc,
	Abstract = {by any state estimation algorithm. Particularly in
                  robotics, it is not very well addressed. This paper
                  introduces a multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based
                  data association algorithm for the simultaneous
                  localization and map building (SLAM) problem in
                  mobile robot navigation. The data association
                  problem is cast in a general discrete optimization
                  framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget
                  tracking is extended for SLAM using sensor location
                  uncertainty with the joint likelihood of
                  measurements over multiple frames as the objective
                  function. Methods for feature initialization and
                  management are also integrated into the
                  algorithm. When clutter is high and features are
                  sparse, the compatibility information of features of
                  a single measurement frame is not sufficient to make
                  effective data-association decisions, thus
                  compromising performance of single-frame-based
                  methods. However, in a multiple-measurement-frame
                  approach, the availability of more than one frame of
                  measurement provides for more effective
                  data-association decisions to be made, as
                  consistency of measurements are looked at in several
                  frames of measurement. Simulations are conducted to
                  verify the performance gains over the conventional
                  nearest neighbor (NN) data association algorithm and
                  the joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB)
                  algorithm, especially in the presence of varying
                  densities of spurious measurements and dynamic
                  objects. Experimental results with ground truth are
                  presented to demonstrate the practicality of the
                  proposed data-association method in complex and
                  large outdoor environments and its effectiveness
                  over single-frame-based NN and JCBB schemes.},

	Abstract = { This paper explores and investigates deep
                  convolutional neural network architectures to
                  increase the efficiency and robustness of semantic
                  segmentation tasks. The proposed solutions are based
                  on up-convolutional networks. We introduce three
                  different architectures in this work. The first
                  architecture, called Part-Net, is designed to tackle
                  the specific problem of human body part segmentation
                  and to provide robustness to overfitting and body
                  part occlusion. The second network, called Fast-Net,
                  is a network specifically designed to provide the
                  smallest computation load without losing
                  representation power. Such an architecture is
                  capable of being run on mobile GPUs. The last
                  architecture, called M-Net, aims to maximize the
                  robustness characteristics of deep semantic
                  segmentation approaches through multiresolution
                  fusion. The networks achieve state-of-the-art
                  performance on the PASCAL Parts dataset and
                  competitive results on the KITTI dataset for road
                  and lane segmentation. Moreover, we introduce a new
                  part segmentation dataset, the Freiburg City
                  dataset, which is designed to bring semantic
                  segmentation to highly realistic robotics
                  scenarios. Additionally, we present results obtained
                  with a ground robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle
                  and a full system to explore the capabilities of
                  human body part segmentation in the context of
                  human--robot interaction. },

@article{doi:10.1177/0278364917732640,
	Abstract = { We consider the following problem: a team of robots
                  is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to
                  collaboratively build a map of the area without a
                  reliable infrastructure for communication. The
                  backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph
                  optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the
                  robots, from which the map can be easily built. The
                  first contribution of this paper is a set of
                  distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization:
                  rather than sending all sensor data to a remote
                  sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very
                  partial and noisy information to reach an agreement
                  on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be
                  considered as a distributed implementation of a
                  two-stage approach that already exists, where we use
                  the Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi
                  Over-Relaxation as workhorses to split the
                  computation among the robots. We also provide
                  conditions under which the proposed distributed
                  protocols converge to the solution of the
                  centralized two-stage approach. As a second
                  contribution, we extend the proposed distributed
                  algorithms to work with the object-based map
                  models. The use of object-based models avoids the
                  exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point
                  clouds or RGB-D data) further reducing the
                  communication burden. Our third contribution is an
                  extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed
                  techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo
                  simulations and field experiments in a military test
                  facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests
                  that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed
                  Gauss--Seidel method) has excellent performance. The
                  Distributed Gauss--Seidel method requires minimal
                  information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales
                  well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a
                  team of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy
                  to implement. Our field tests show that the combined
                  use of our distributed algorithms and object-based
                  models reduces the communication requirements by
                  several orders of magnitude and enables distributed
                  mapping with large teams of robots in real-world
                  problems. The source code is available for download

  abstract =     {{For robots to navigate and interact more richly
                  with the world around them, they will likely require
                  a deeper understanding of the world in which they
                  operate. In robotics and related research fields,
                  the study of understanding is often referred to as
                  semantics, which dictateswhat does the world “mean”
                  to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question
                  ofhow to represent that meaning. With humans and
                  robots increasingly operating in the same world, the
                  prospects of human–robot interaction also
                  bringsemantics and ontology of natural language into
                  the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers
                  like increasing availability of training data and
                  computational resources, semantics is a rapidly
                  growing research area in robotics. The field has
                  received significant attention in the research
                  literature to date, but most reviews and surveys
                  have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the
                  technical research issues regarding its use in
                  specific robotic topics like mapping or
                  segmentation, or its relevance to one particular
                  application domain like autonomous driving. A new
                  treatment is therefore required, and is also timely
                  because so much relevant research has occurred since
                  many of the key surveys were published. This survey
                  therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where
                  semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a
                  taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to
                  robotics, split into four broad categories of
                  activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or
                  both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens
                  of major topics including fundamentals from the
                  computer vision field and key robotics research
                  areas utilizing semantics, including mapping,
                  navigation and interaction with the world. The
                  survey also covers key practical considerations,
                  including enablers like increased data availability
                  and improved computational hardware, and major
                  application areas where semantics is or is likely to
                  play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to
                  provide researchers across academia and industry
                  with a comprehensive reference that helps facilitate
                  future research in this exciting field.}},

  year =         {2021},
  abstract =     {Robotics applications have hard time constraints and
                  heavy computational burdens that can greatly benefit
                  from domain-specific hardware accelerators. For the
                  latency-critical problem of robot motion planning
                  and control, there exists a performance gap of at
                  least an order of magnitude between joint actuator
                  response rates and state-of-the-art software
                  solutions. Hardware acceleration can close this gap,
                  but it is essential to define automated hardware
                  design flows to keep the design process agile as
                  applications and robot platforms evolve. To address
                  this challenge, we introduce robomorphic computing:
                  a methodology to transform robot morphology into a
                  customized hardware accelerator morphology. In this
                  work, we (i) present this design methodology, using
                  robot topology and structure to exploit parallelism
                  and matrix sparsity patterns in accelerator
                  hardware; (ii) use the methodology to generate a
                  parameterized accelerator design for the gradient of
                  rigid body dynamics, a key kernel in motion
                  planning; (iii) evaluate FPGA and synthesized ASIC
                  implementations of this accelerator for an
                  industrial manipulator robot; and (iv) describe how
                  the design can be automatically customized for other
                  robot models. Using robomorphic computing, our FPGA
                  accelerator achieves speedups of 8x and 86x over
                  CPU and GPU latency, and maintains an overall
                  speedup from 1.9x to 2.9x deployed in an
                  end-to-end coprocessor system. ASIC synthesis
                  indicates an additional factor of 7.2x. We
                  describe how this principled approach generalizes to
                  more complex robot platforms, such as quadrupeds and
                  humanoids, as well as to other computational kernels
                  in robotics, outlining a path forward for future
                  robomorphic computing accelerators.},

  abstract =     {{Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the
                  process of constructing a global model of an
                  environment from local observations of it; this is a
                  foundational capability for mobile robots,
                  supporting such core functions as planning,
                  navigation, and control. This article reviews recent
                  progress in SLAM, focusing on advances in the
                  expressive capacity of the environmental models used
                  in SLAM systems (representation) and the performance
                  of the algorithms used to estimate these models from
                  data (inference). A prominent theme of recent SLAM
                  research is the pursuit of environmental
                  representations (including learned representations)
                  that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry
                  and appearance to model properties such as
                  hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and
                  semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents
                  with a more comprehensive understanding of the
                  world, enabling more versatile and intelligent
                  operation. A second major theme is a revitalized
                  interest in the mathematical properties of the SLAM
                  estimation problem itself (including its
                  computational and information-theoretic performance
                  limits); this work has led to the development of
                  novel classes of certifiable and robust inference
                  methods that dramatically improve the reliability of
                  SLAM systems in real-world operation. We survey
                  these advances with an emphasis on their
                  ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration
                  autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open
                  challenges and a perspective on future research
                  directions.}},
