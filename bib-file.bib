  Abstract =	 {The ability of human visual system to detect visual
                  saliency is extraordinarily fast and
                  reliable. However, com- putational modeling of this
                  basic intelligent behavior still remains a
                  challenge. This paper presents a simple method for
                  the visual saliency detection.  Our model is
                  independent of features, categories, or other forms
                  of prior knowledge of the objects. By analyz- ing
                  the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract the
                  spec- tral residual of an image in spectral domain,
                  and propose a fast method to construct the
                  corresponding saliency map in spatial domain.  We
                  test this model on both natural pictures and
                  artificial images such as psychological
                  patterns. The result indicate fast and robust
                  saliency detection of our method},

  Title =	 {Inverse Depth Parameterization for Monocular {SLAM}},
  Volume =	 {24},
  Year =	 {2008},
  Abstract =	 {We present a new parametrization for point fea-
                  tures within monocular simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate
                  representation of un- certainty during undelayed
                  initialization and beyond, all within the standard
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept is
                  direct parametrization of the inverse depth of
                  features rela- tive to the camera locations from
                  which they were first viewed, which produces
                  measurement equations with a high degree of
                  linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features over a huge range of depths, even
                  those that are so far from the cam- era that they
                  present little parallax during motion---maintaining
                  sufficient representative uncertainty that these
                  points retain the op- portunity to ``come in''
                  smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger
                  movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in
                  the sense that even distant features are immediately
                  used to improve cam- era motion estimates, acting
                  initially as bearing references but not permanently
                  labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization
                  remains well behaved for features at all stages of
                  SLAM process- ing, but has the drawback in
                  computational terms that each point is represented
                  by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard
                  three of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show
                  that once the depth estimate of a feature is
                  sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely
                  be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose
                  a linearity index that allows automatic detection
                  and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency---only
                  low parallax features need be maintained in inverse
                  depth form for long periods. We present a real-time
                  implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization
                  is validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system
                  featuring a hand- held single camera with no
                  additional sensing. Experiments show robust
                  operation in challenging indoor and outdoor
                  environments with a very large ranges of scene
                  depth, varied motion, and also real time 360◦ loop
                  closing.  },

The two systems have different dynamics, and it is thus convenient to seperate the systems and provide loose synchronisation. The mobilty system is controlled using a behaviour based approach. The manipulation control is carried out using HDS. The two systems are coupled using an observer. The full system is implemented using a software framework named Mobile Manipulation Control Architecture (MMCA). The software includes a dedicated language for specification of tasks. The task specification is built around the HDS primitives.},

Until know most widely used invariat in kinodynamics was time, i.e most of the cost functions were expressed in terms of time. The conclusions are that communication between agents while searching a maze is equivalent to a single agent with pebbles seraching the maze, i.e. side-effecting the environment has the same complexity as communication. Also if an automaton has an counter there exist a log-space algorithm to search the maze vs. linear time algorithms.},

The types of properties he investigates are of type that the action specifivation doesn affect the parameters of the leis-guard and that there is not such action whose postcondition is not a precondition of another action, or an action whose precondition doesn't have and action with the same postcondition.},

In order to deal with intractability of the plannig problem we can either use powerfull parallel processing or use an conventional search space algorithm which will be swapped out in such a way that other processes will have chance to react to inputs in real time. If rules are fixed (as in production systems ) in many cases inference can be precomputed - they propose some compromise as a general purpose searching hardware for embeding planners for real-time sytems. they have the perceptions componesnts tied together in a tree like hierachy and some kind of 'mediating behaviours' which are doing mediation between behaviours.},

Model should be hierarchical build bottom up, with symbolic and topological information at the top. They have a generic building model and it's instance, example is presented on a general model of hallway, he is looking only on the horizontal and vertical edges - solution is fast epipolar stereo across horizon. For navigation there are two different methods. One is without a model the lines are classified as part of the model or obstacsles as the robot moves it creates a bounding polygon which represents the boundary of the free space. For model -based navigation the system given a goal builds model and then plans motions nad sensing to as the robot moves it determines it's new action based on what it sees. The simple FSM model of the navigation in the hallway was implemented and tasks like enter the second door on the left could be specified.},

He introduces and idea of the triangle table used to monitor the execution and look always for the best matching rule. It can happen that as a result of the interaction with the world some of the actions get skipped, or the other gets repeated. In case none of the rules matches, replanning occurs. One way how to do planning is to use forward production},

	Comment = {The task is first decomposed among the agents possibly having different skills, decomposition is followed by allocation where the negotiation is taking place between different agent, negotiating about different tasks. After the allocation each of the robots gets it's subtask and develops it's own plan, there is a problem in oreder not to get conflicting plans in terms of accomplishing subtask and using resources. While each robot executes it's plan the failure may occur and the the planner is reinitiated. There is a lot of planning going on which may be quite time consuming also robots are assigned priorities in the allocation phase. Is a good idea? Negotiation is going on only on the symbolic level and is to certain extent recursive. For the cooperation, we may need somthing on the sensory level. Pusher and Supervisor Example.

There are three different knid of specifications one are guarantee properties, this means that guarantee properties with certain state of F at least ones or set of states. The complement to it are safety properties, which should prevent visiting certain states at all and the thrird type of properties is reccurence properties which should guarantee that certain state will be visited infinitely often. If the specification is specifies as a logical formula the reactive program can be synthetized in three steps. Firts the formula is translated to deterministic omega-automaton, then this automaton is transformed into a game graph, from which the winning strategy and its implementation by a reactive program is constructed. First and third step are difficult and better synthesis algorithms and complexity bounds should be found. Thanks to overview by},

Visual routines can be viewed as elementary operations or their combinations (either parallel or sequential comb.) Examples of elementary visual routines are : 1. Shift of the processing or focus (just apply particular operation to some region). 2. Indexing (the region to which the operation will be applied is indexed by some distinctive feature). 3. Bouded activation (operation is applied over surface or boundary stopping at discontinuities). 4. Boundary tracing (tracing a single contour or number of contours) 5. Marking (operation of marking a location - means location was remembered and the processsing can return there when desirable.)},

	Year = 1998,
	Abstract = {Since Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approaches
                  reached a prime of importance in interactive robot
                  programming, sensor technology for tracking the
                  user's actions and behavior is attached more and
                  more importance. However, traditional methods based
                  on single sensor system input are already at their
                  limits, since PbD is an application area where
                  real-time requirement do play an important
                  role. Thus, a sensor fusion approach is proposed
                  which serves input data for a finite state
                  automat. The input sources are on the one hand a
                  data-glove which classifies different grips and on
                  the other hand a movable camera head which tracks
                  the movements of the data glove as well as estimates
                  object positions. Both sensor sources use time
                  efficient algorithms, since sensory data must be
                  processed in real-time. The efficiency of this
                  approach is proven in a PbD environment were
                  flexible infusion bags are handled and respective
                  actions and object positions are recognized.}}

                  performed by a human teacher is crucial to further
                  processing steps in Programing by demonstration
                  (Pbd) which has reached a prime of importance in
                  interactive robot programing. This paper outlines a
                  concept of how this can be done using visual and
                  finger measuring sensors. As input sources serve on
                  the one hand a data glove which will classify
                  several gestures and grasps and on the other hand a
                  stereo camera head and a fixed ceiling camera. The
                  hardware used at our institute is presented just as
                  the technical concepts of processing and fusioning
                  acquired sensor information, s o called elementary
                  cognitive operators. All sensor sources must use
                  time-effici ent algorithms, since sensor data must
                  be processed in real-time.}}

                  \cite{barnard02}\cite{barnard03}\cite{barnard01a}\cite{barnard01}:
                  It is very important to mention the work of Barnard
                  et. al. in the context of automated annotation of
                  images and scene representation. \cite{barnard02}
                  won the the best paper award in Cognitive Vision at
                  ECCV 2002. The goal of their work is to attach words
                  (annotations) to images and image regions. The
                  specialty is that they learn the joint statistics of
                  words and image regions from annotated training
                  images. After having learned the models, words can
                  be attached to images outside the training set
                  (auto-annotation). The work of Barnard et. al. is
                  based on methods for modeling co-occurrence data,
                  especially the work of Hofmann and Puzicha
                  \cite{hofmann98a}. They developed a flat and
                  hierarchical models for dyadic (co-occurrence) data,
                  that is data that has associations of different
                  types (e.g. image features and image annotations).}}

                  The goal of this research is semantic scene
                  categorization for CBIR. Through a set of
                  psychophysical experiments the authors identify two
                  main axis of human categorization: human
                  vs. non-human and natural vs. man-made. From these
                  main axis, after more experiments, a set of 20 scene
                  categories that seem consistent to the subjects
                  evolve. The subjects are asked to find attributes
                  and semantic descriptors for each of those
                  categories. In a next step these semantic features
                  (e.g. "busy scene") are translated to
                  image-processing features (e.g. "high spatial
                  frequencies"). The image-processing features are
                  used to automatically classify unseen scenes into
                  the semantic categories. The results are mainly
                  qualitatively, but quite interesting. Unfortunately,
                  the paper hasn't been published officially yet. I
                  just got a copy by the authors.}}

                  The work by Oliva and Torralba is based
                  psychophysically on the PhD work of Aude Oliva
                  \cite{oliva00}\cite{schyns94}. Even when viewing
                  scenes only for a very short time period, humans are
                  able to extract enough visual information to
                  accurately recognize its categorical properties. The
                  authors thus use the discrete Fourier transform
                  (DFT) and the windowed DFT in order to describe and
                  to learn the spatial properties of certain scene
                  categories. In \cite{oliva01}, they learn the
                  degrees of naturalness, of openness, of roughness,
                  of expansion and of ruggedness (spatial envelope
                  properties) in order to sort unseen images along
                  these axes. In \cite{torralba01a}, the DFT and the
                  windowed DFT are used to determine the global depth
                  of a scene without absolute depth measurements. In
                  general, the goal of the authors' work is to
                  generate scene-centered descriptions from the
                  spatial envelope properties

                  scenes. They carry out a set of psychophysical

                  as object stacks or configurations and the
                  hierarchical sampling scheme for such
                  configurations. Configurations in the sense of this
                  paper are collections of model parameters for
                  multiple object. On one side, this allows to model
                  not only the behaviour of individual objects,
                  e.g. motion but also the behaviour of object groups,
                  in particular addition and deletion of objects. On
                  the other side, stacking multiple objects together
                  increases the problem search space exponentially. In
                  order to overcome the severe computational problems
                  arising from the increased search space, the paper
                  introduces a hierarchical sampling algorithm. In
                  principle, the configurations are broken into
                  sub-configurations according to a subdivison of the
                  image in non-overlapping regions. This smaller
                  sub-configurations are than localy sampled before
                  reassigned to global configurations and propagated
                  globally.},

                  indistinguishable objects by means of prarticle
                  filtering (SMCM). The two main contributions are i)
                  a probabilistic exclusion principle supressing
                  simultaneous reinforcement of mutually exclusive
                  object hypotheses by a single piece of evidence and
                  ii) a new sampling scheme - partitioned sampling -
                  for the applied sequential Monte Carlo method. The
                  probabilistic exclusion principle used as
                  observation model inhibits reinforcement if a piece
                  of data was generated by overlapping, i.e. mutually
                  exclusive objects. This exclusion principle prevents
                  the "locking" of object hypotheses on the same
                  object whenever two object are close or even
                  overlapping. Partitioned sampling increases the
                  efficiency of the resampling step required for
                  particle filtering and thus helps to overcome the
                  curse of dimensionality in case of high-dimensional
                  problem state space. The basic idea is to separate
                  the sampling into two steps. First, the object
                  hypotheses in the foreground, i.e. the hypotheses of
                  fully visible objects, are sampled and
                  propagated. Then the remaining hypotheses,
                  i.e. those of objects partially occluded by objects
                  of the first subset are processed. This approach
                  leads to a much better approximation of the
                  posterior which allows to decrease the required
                  number of particles.}}

                  effectively reduce the computational demands for a
                  given problem. In principle, partitioned sampling is
                  a statistical analogy \emph{hierarchical

                  in particular for this kind of (multi-)object
                  tracker. Besides partitioned sampling, the paper
                  introduces the notion of \emph{survival diagnostics}
                  and \emph{survival rate}. Both quantities can be
                  used for assessing the efficacy of a particle
                  filter. Survival diagnostic --
                  a.k.a. \emph{effective sample set size}
                  \cite{doucet:02:a} -- measures the effective sample

                  combines multiple cues by reasoning about the
                  individual cue's reliability. Continuous global
                  evidence-based Bayesian modality fusion has four
                  main advantages: 1) Continuous sampling reflects the
                  complexity of Bayesian inference most
                  appropriately. 2) Using global evidence allows to
                  consider all observations from a single modality for
                  inference. Most voting approaches take only a single
                  observation per modality into consideration. 3)
                  Bayesian inference allows to introduce new evidence
                  one by one. This provides the ability to distinguish
                  between mandatory modalities required for object
                  tracking and optional modalities which give only
                  further hints about the presence of an
                  object. Furthermore, the nature of Bayesian modality
                  fusion allows to implement on-demand computation for
                  computationally expensive modalities that are only
                  computet selectively for disambiguating ambigous

                  model. Using the standard machinery of particle

                  distribution, the tracker in this contribution
                  relies on an adaptive color model of the tracked
                  object. This target distribution is implemented by
                  color histograms. This approach gives a significant
                  increase of robustness against non-rigidity,
                  rotation and partial occlusion. The paper compares
                  the proposed approach with \emph{mean shift},
                  another tracking method which recently became quite
                  popular.},

                  that provide consistency of pictorial
                  representation. The pictures have been standardized
                  on four variables of central relevance to memory and
                  cognitive processing: name agreement, image
                  agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity. The
                  intercorrelations among the four measures were low,
                  suggesting that they are indices of different
                  attributes of the pictures. The concepts were
                  selected to provide exemplars from several widely
                  studied semantic categories. Sources of naming
                  variance, and mean familiarity and complexity of the
                  exemplars, differed significantly across the set of

                  activity predicts both greater prefrontal activity

                  algorithms that integrate information about place,
                  distance and direction, but the implementation of
                  these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly
                  understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial
                  entorhinal cortex {dMEC} contains directionally
                  oriented, topographically organised neural map of
                  the spatial environment. Its key unit is the "grid
                  cell" which is activated whenever the animal's
                  position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid
                  of equilateral trriangles spanning the surface of
                  the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a
                  common orientation and spacing, but their certex
                  locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and
                  size of individual fields increase from dorsal to
                  central dMEC. The map is anchored to external
                  lanndmarks but persists in their absence, suggesting
                  the grid cells might be part ofa generalised path
                  integration based map of the spatial environment}}

                  robotics, it is not very well addressed. This paper
                  introduces a multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based
                  data association algorithm for the simultaneous
                  localization and map building (SLAM) problem in
                  mobile robot navigation. The data association
                  problem is cast in a general discrete optimization
                  framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget
                  tracking is extended for SLAM using sensor location
                  uncertainty with the joint likelihood of
                  measurements over multiple frames as the objective
                  function. Methods for feature initialization and
                  management are also integrated into the
                  algorithm. When clutter is high and features are
                  sparse, the compatibility information of features of
                  a single measurement frame is not sufficient to make
                  effective data-association decisions, thus
                  compromising performance of single-frame-based
                  methods. However, in a multiple-measurement-frame
                  approach, the availability of more than one frame of
                  measurement provides for more effective
                  data-association decisions to be made, as
                  consistency of measurements are looked at in several
                  frames of measurement. Simulations are conducted to
                  verify the performance gains over the conventional
                  nearest neighbor (NN) data association algorithm and
                  the joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB)
                  algorithm, especially in the presence of varying
                  densities of spurious measurements and dynamic
                  objects. Experimental results with ground truth are
                  presented to demonstrate the practicality of the
                  proposed data-association method in complex and
                  large outdoor environments and its effectiveness
                  over single-frame-based NN and JCBB schemes.}}

	Abstract = {A visual servo tracking controller is developed in
                  this paper for a monocular camera system mounted on
                  an underactuated wheeled mobile robot (WMR) subject
                  to nonholonomic motion constraints (i.e., the
                  camera-in-hand problem). A prerecorded image
                  sequence (e.g., a video) of three target points is
                  used to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By
                  comparing the target points from a stationary
                  reference image with the corresponding target points
                  in the live image and the prerecorded sequence of
                  images, projective geometric relationships are
                  exploited to construct Euclidean homographies. The
                  information obtained by decomposing the Euclidean

	Abstract = {Recent work in the object recognition community has
                  yielded a class of interest-point-based features
                  that are stable under significant changes in scale,
                  viewpoint, and illumination, making them ideally
                  suited to landmark-based navigation. Although many
                  such features may be visible in a given view of the
                  robot's environment, only a few such features are
                  necessary to estimate the robot's position and
                  orientation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of automatically selecting, from the entire set of
                  features visible in the robot's environment, the
                  minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
                  navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose
                  the world into a small number of maximally sized
                  regions, such that at each position in a given
                  region, the same small set of features is
                  visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
                  formulation of the problem, and prove that it is
                  NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of
                  approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the
                  decompositions from the real image data to measure
                  the localization performance versus the undecomposed
                  map.}}

                  for social interaction studies is presented. We are
                  interested in studying the impact of passage
                  behaviours in casual encounters. While the system
                  offers assistance in locating the appropriate office
                  that a visitor wants to reach, it is expected to
                  engage in a passing behaviour to allow free passage
                  for other persons that it may encounter. Through use
                  of such an approach it is possible to study the
                  effect of social interaction in a situation that is
                  much more natural than out-of-context user
                  studies. The system has been tested in an early
                  evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7
                  hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were
                  registered and 13 passage behaviors were performed
                  to conclude that this framework can be successfully
                  used for the evaluationof passing behaviors in
                  natural contexts of operation. },

	Year = 2006,
	Abstract = {Casual encounters with mobile robots for non-
                  experts can be a challenge due to lack of an
                  interaction model. The present work is based on the
                  rules from proxemics which are used to design a
                  passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral
                  distance of passage is a key parameter to
                  consider. An implemented system has been used in a
                  small study to verify the basic parametric design
                  for such a system. In total 10 subjects evaluated
                  variations in proxemics for encounters with a robot
                  in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates
                  that entering the intimate sphere of people is less
                  comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is
                  also considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of
                  avoidance is a behaviour that must be carefully
                  tuned. }}

	Abstract = {This paper presents our recently developed approach
                  to constructing a hierarchical representation of
                  visual input that aims to enable recognition and
                  detection of a large number of object
                  categories. Inspired by the principles of efficient
                  indexing, robust matching, and ideas of
                  compositionality, our approach learns a hierarchy of
                  spatially flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an
                  unsupervised, statistics-driven manner. Starting
                  with simple, frequent features, we learn the
                  statistically most significant compositions (parts
                  composed of parts), which consequently define the
                  next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer
                  after layer, optimally adjusting to the visual
                  data. Lower layers are learned in a
                  category-independent way to obtain complex, yet
                  sharable visual building blocks, which is a crucial
                  step towards a scalable representation. Higher
                  layers of the hierarchy, on the other hand, are
                  constructed by using specific categories, achieving
                  a category representation with a small number of
                  highly generalizable parts that gained their
                  structural flexibility through composition within
                  the hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can
                  be efficiently and continuously added to the system
                  by adding a small number of parts only in the higher
                  layers. The approach is demonstrated on a large
                  collection of images and a variety of object
                  categories.},

@inproceedings{Minnen03Expectation,
  Abstract =	 {Video-based recognition and prediction of a
                  temporally extended activity can benefit from a
                  detailed description of high-level expectations
                  about the activity. Stochastic grammars allow for an
                  efficient representation of such expectations and
                  are well-suited for the specification of temporally
                  well-ordered activities. In this paper, we extend
                  stochastic grammars by adding event parameters,
                  state checks, and sensitivity to an internal scene
                  model. We present an implemented system that uses
                  human-specified grammars to recognize a person
                  performing the Towers of Hanoi task from a video
                  sequence by analyzing object interaction
                  events. Experimental results from several videos
                  show robust recognition of the full task and its
                  constituent sub-tasks even though no appearance
                  models of the objects in the video are provided.
                  These experiments include videos of the task
                  performed with different shaped objects and with
                  distracting and extraneous interactions.},

@inproceedings{Minnen06Discovering,
  Abstract =	 {We present an approach to activity discovery, the
                  unsupervised identification and modeling of human
                  actions embedded in a larger sensor stream.
                  Activity discovery can be seen as the inverse of the
                  activity recognition problem.  Rather than learn
                  models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to
                  discover motifs, sets of similar subsequences within
                  the raw sensor stream, without the benefit of labels
                  or manual segmentation.  These motifs are
                  statistically unlikely and thus typically correspond
                  to important or characteristic actions within the
                  activity. The problem of activity discovery differs
                  from typical motif discovery, such as locating
                  protein binding sites, because of the nature of time
                  series data representing human activity.  For
                  example, in activity data, motifs will tend to be
                  sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only
                  exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate
                  time warping.  In this paper, we motivate the
                  activity discovery problem and present our approach
                  for efficient discovery of meaningful actions from
                  sensor data representing human activity.  We
                  empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise
                  data set captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis
                  inertial sensor.  Our algorithm successfully
                  discovers motifs that correspond to the real
                  exercises with a recall rate of 96.3 percent and
                  overall accuracy of 86.7 percent over six exercises
                  and 864 occurrences.},

  abstract =	 {This paper briefly describes the results of a ten
                  year, and still on-going, research program in
                  decentralised sensing systems. This program covers
                  both the theoretical development of data fusion
                  methods appropriate to networks of decentralised
                  sensors and the practical implementation of these in
                  both civilian and military contexts. The methods
                  employed for studying the decentralized data fusion
                  problem are based on the information-filter
                  formulation of the Kalman filter algorithm and on
                  information-theoretic methods derived from Bayes
                  theorem. This theory is briefly described in context
                  of a number of practical implementations of
                  decentralised data fusion methods in surveillance
                  and control applications. The paper describes
                  specific theoretical tools developed to address such
                  issues as; decentralised communication management,
                  model distribution, decentralised data association
                  and fault detection, sensor control (information
                  gathering, target cuing and hand-off), decentralised
                  picture compilation and map building. Finally, we
                  describe our current work deployment of
                  decentralized, large-scale systems of systems
                  demonstrations.}
