  abstract =     {Asphalt pavement distresses are the major concern of
                  underdeveloped and developed nations for the smooth running of
                  daily life commute. Among various pavement failures, numerous
                  research can be found on pothole detection as they are
                  injurious to automobiles and passengers that may turn into an
                  accident. This work is intended to explore the potential of
                  deep learning models and deploy three superlative deep
                  learning models on edge devices for pothole detection. In this
                  work, we have exploited the AI kit (OAK-D) on a single-board
                  computer (Raspberry Pi) as an edge platform for pothole
                  detection. Detailed real-time performance comparison of
                  state-of-the-art deep learning models and object detection
                  frameworks (YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Tiny-YOLOv4,
                  YOLOv5, and SSD-mobilenetv2) for pothole detection is
                  presented. The experimentation is performed on an image
                  dataset with pothole in diverse road conditions and
                  illumination variations as well as on real-time video captured
                  through a moving vehicle. The Tiny-YOLOv4, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5
                  evince the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 80.04\%,
                  85.48\%, and 95\%, respectively, on the image set, thus
                  proving the strength of the proposed approach for pothole
                  detection and deployed on OAK-D for real-time detection. The
                  study corroborated Tiny-YOLOv4 as the befitted model for
                  real-time pothole detection with 90\% detection accuracy and
                  31.76 FPS.},

  abstract =     {Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a
                  collection of conflict-free paths for a team of multiple
                  agents while minimizing some global cost, such as the sum of
                  the travel time of all agents, or the travel time of the last
                  agent. Conflict Based Search (CBS) is a leading complete and
                  optimal MAPF algorithm that lazily explores the joint agent
                  state space, using an admissible heuristic joint plan. Such an
                  admissible heuristic joint plan is computed by combining
                  individual shortest paths computed without considering
                  inter-agent conflicts, and becoming gradually more informed as
                  constraints are added to the individual agents' path-planning
                  problems to avoid discovered conflicts. In this paper, we seek
                  to speed up CBS by finding a more informed heuristic joint
                  plan that is bounded. We first propose the budgeted
                  Class-Ordered A* (bCOA*), a novel algorithm that finds the
                  least-cost path with the minimal number of conflicts that is
                  upper bounded in terms of path length. Then, we propose a
                  novel bounded-cost variant of CBS, called CBS-Budget (CBSB) by
                  using bCOA* search at the low-level search of the CBS and by
                  using a modified focal search at the high-level search of the
                  CBS. We prove that CBSB is complete and bounded-suboptimal. In
                  our numerical experiments, CBSB finds a near-optimal solution
                  for hundreds of agents within a fraction of a second. CBSB
                  shows state-of-the-art performance, comparable to Explicit
                  Estimation CBS (EECBS), an enhanced recent version of CBS. On
                  the other hand, CBSB is much easier to implement than EECBS,
                  since only one priority queue at the low-level search is
                  needed, as in CBS, and only two priority queues at the
                  high-level search are needed, as in Enhanced CBS (ECBS).}

                  perimeter defense scenario, in which a team of intruders try
                  to score by reaching the target region while a team of
                  defenders try to minimize the score by intercepting those
                  intruders. We describe how the small-scale differential games
                  are solved and are leveraged to design team strategies in the
                  large-scale swarm versus swarm scenarios. Three different
                  approaches to analyze the large-scale games (MM, MIS, and LGR)
                  are introduced with comments on their relative strengths and
                  weaknesses. As a unique contribution of this paper, we discuss
                  how the existing results can be extended into more general
                  problem formulations. Furthermore, we point out the
                  limitations of the current work and suggest potential
                  directions for future research.",

Expert priors have various carriers, and the existing technology primarily utilizes expert priors derived from demonstration data and interaction data. This paper proposed a deep imitative reinforcement learning method for decision-making in autonomous vehicles, synergizing the expert priors in both demonstration data and interaction data. The gradient projection technique was adopted to mitigate gradient conflicts between the demonstration and interaction data during the training phase, thus preventing learning stagnation and enhancing agent performance. Furthermore, we deployed the proposed decision-making method on real autonomous vehicles. An augmented reality experiment was conducted with random virtual traffic flows from the simulator. The simulation and experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method enhanced training efficiency and safety performance, and preliminarily overcame sim-to-real challenges.}},

  abstractNote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In industry it is not uncommon for machines
                  to outlive the purpose for which they were commissioned; at
                  times these perfectly serviceable devices are simply
                  decommissioned and left neglected in storage to slowly decay.
                  Motors, actuators, and structural mechanics are still
                  operational, while control system and their design purpose may
                  have passed into obsolescence. In applied educational fields
                  students are often reluctant to consider working with
                  seemingly obsolete systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reconfigurable systems may offer a solution
                  to this challenge for education and training in the field of
                  autonomous robotics. Often custom-built devices are beyond the
                  expenditure budget constraints of a college department for one
                  course. Mecanum wheeled robots with tractive forces at each
                  wheel offer the opportunity to explore translation
                  controllable in a degree of freedom that is equal to total
                  degrees of freedom of the robot. They are also excellent
                  platform to demonstrate and study holonomic drive
                  theories.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this proposed
                  study we seek to explore the viability of reconfigurable

                  autonomous vehicle (AV) stack. While high-definition (HD) maps
                  can readily provide such information, they suffer from high
                  labeling and maintenance costs. Accordingly, many recent works
                  have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from
                  sensor data. The vast majority of recent approaches encode
                  multi-camera observations into an intermediate representation,
                  e.g., a bird's eye view (BEV) grid, and produce vector map
                  elements via a decoder. While this architecture is performant,
                  it decimates much of the information encoded in the
                  intermediate representation, preventing downstream tasks
                  (e.g., behavior prediction) from leveraging them. In this
                  work, we propose exposing the rich internal features of online
                  map estimation methods and show how they enable more tightly
                  integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In
                  doing so, we find that directly accessing internal BEV
                  features yields up to 73\% faster inference speeds and up to
                  29\% more accurate predictions on the real-world nuScenes
                  dataset.}}

  abstract =     {In the context of bird’s-eye view traffic scenarios, accurate
                  prediction of future trajectories for various traffic agents
                  (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) is crucial for driving safety
                  and decision planning. In this paper, we present a generative
                  trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both
                  collision-free modeling and additional reconstruction for
                  future scene context. For the social encoder, we leverage the
                  collision prior by incorporating collision-free constraints
                  (CFC). We construct a social model composed of multiple
                  graphs, where each graph points to the collision prior
                  calculated from uniform direction sampling. In the scene
                  encoder, we employ an attention module to establish
                  connections between trajectory motion and all scene image
                  pixels. Additionally, we reconstruct a goal response map (GRM)
                  aligned with the intended one, thereby enhancing the scene
                  representations. Experiments conducted on nuScenes and ETH/UCY
                  datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
                  framework, achieving a 13.8% reduction in off-road rate on
                  nuScenes and an average 13.2% reduction in collision rate on
                  ETH/UCY datasets.}

  abstract =     {{Autonomous driving relies on real-time perception of
                  environmental semantic maps to make decisions, accurate and
                  real-time perception of environmental semantics is crucial for
                  safe navigation, as well as for efficient construction of
                  high-definition maps in the backend. Our research found that
                  when the output space of the semantic map perception model is
                  an orthogonal projection subspace of the input perception
                  space, it significantly improves the accuracy and real-time
                  performance of map semantic segmentation while reducing
                  learning pressure on deep network models. Based on this, we
                  propose a simple yet efficient semantic map segmentation
                  network that aims to achieve extremely fast speed and
                  precision. Furthermore, we implement a semantic map fusion
                  process using a Bayesian framework that promotes global
                  semantic information accumulation in local semantics over time
                  and space. Our experimental results demonstrate the
                  superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
                  performance in network speed and mIoU metrics. At the same
                  spatial resolution of semantic maps, our method reaches over
                  350+ frames per second, which is at least 15 times faster than
                  the previous state-of-the-art method. Code released at

  abstract =     {{Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has garnered significant
                  attention from both academia and industry due to its intrinsic
                  advantages, particularly its implicit representation and novel
                  view synthesis capabilities. With the rapid advancements in
                  deep learning, a multitude of methods have emerged to explore
                  the potential applications of NeRF in the domain of Autonomous
                  Driving (AD). However, a conspicuous void is apparent within
                  the current literature. To bridge this gap, this paper
                  conducts a comprehensive survey of NeRF's applications in the
                  context of AD. Our survey is structured to categorize NeRF's
                  applications in Autonomous Driving (AD), specifically
                  encompassing perception, 3D reconstruction, simultaneous
                  localization and mapping (SLAM), and simulation. We delve into
                  in-depth analysis and summarize the findings for each
                  application category, and conclude by providing insights and
                  discussions on future directions in this field. We hope this
                  paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers in
                  this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
                  survey specifically focused on the applications of NeRF in the
                  Autonomous Driving domain.}},

  abstract =     {{Background: Recent developments in capturing devices like
                  kinect, Intel real sense camera etc., has impelled research in
                  3D reconstruction especially in the dynamic scene and the
                  performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and speed
                  has increased and thus, have supported many application like
                  teleportation, gaming, free view point video, CG films etc.
                  This paper provides systematic literature review of 3D
                  reconstruction techniques applied in dynamic scene. The
                  objective of this systematic literature review is to provide
                  the detail technical progress in 3D reconstruction techniques
                  for dynamic scene and to find the research gap in this field.
                  Purpose: This paper presents a systematic literature review of
                  the current state of the art that focuses on 3D reconstruction
                  of non-rigid object, articulated motion and human performance
                  in real-time. We further discuss the limitations of current
                  methods and emphasize promising technologies for future
                  development. Methods: Search was conducted on five databases
                  to find 3D reconstruction techniques for dynamic scene. As
                  reconstruction of dynamic scene can be further categorized as
                  rigid object 3D reconstruction and non-rigid object
                  reconstruction based on the object being reconstructed in the
                  dynamic scene. Thus we have searched for both categories for
                  review and we have concentrated on the dynamic scene generated
                  where object is dynamic while camera is static. Results: 281
                  papers were initially searched further than after abstract
                  screening 100 were selected later after detail study 46 were
                  selected for systematic literature review and are presented in
                  the table.}},

  abstract =     {Modern autonomous driving system is characterized as modular
                  tasks in sequential order, i.e., perception, prediction, and
                  planning. In order to perform a wide diversity of tasks and
                  achieve advanced-level intelligence, contemporary approaches
                  either deploy standalone models for individual tasks, or
                  design a multi-task paradigm with separate heads. However,
                  they might suffer from accumulative errors or deficient task
                  coordination. Instead, we argue that a favorable framework
                  should be devised and optimized in pursuit of the ultimate
                  goal, i.e., planning of the self-driving car. Oriented at
                  this, we revisit the key components within perception and
                  prediction, and prioritize the tasks such that all these tasks
                  contribute to planning. We introduce Unified Autonomous
                  Driving (UniAD), a comprehensive framework up-to-date that
                  incorporates full-stack driving tasks in one network. It is
                  exquisitely devised to leverage advantages of each module, and
                  provide complementary feature abstractions for agent
                  interaction from a global perspective. Tasks are communicated
                  with unified query interfaces to facilitate each other toward
                  planning. We instantiate UniAD on the challenging nuScenes
                  benchmark. With extensive ablations, the effectiveness of
                  using such a philosophy is proven by substantially
                  outperforming previous state-of-the-arts in all aspects. Code

                  demonstrations is promising, but the uncertainty and
                  non-deterministic nature of planning make it challenging. In
                  this work, to cope with the uncertainty problem, we propose
                  VADv2, an end-to-end driving model based on probabilistic
                  planning. VADv2 takes multi-view image sequences as input in a
                  streaming manner, transforms sensor data into environmental
                  token embeddings, outputs the probabilistic distribution of
                  action, and samples one action to control the vehicle. Only
                  with camera sensors, VADv2 achieves state-of-the-art
                  closed-loop performance on the CARLA Town05 benchmark,
                  significantly outperforming all existing methods. It runs

                  the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where

                  from discrete sequence modeling to model how vehicles,
                  pedestrians and cyclists interact in driving scenarios. Using
                  a simple data-driven tokenization scheme, we discretize
                  trajectories to centimeter-level resolution using a small

                  motion tokens with a GPT-like encoder-decoder that is

                  development. Simulators help develop, test, and improve
                  driving systems without putting humans, vehicles, or their
                  environment at risk. However, simulators face a major
                  challenge: They rely on realistic, scalable, yet interesting

                  trajectory distributions for decision-making and control.
                  Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to
                  generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable
                  reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution
                  captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided
                  denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to
                  both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a
                  general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose
                  DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization
                  with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box
                  non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data
                  manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during
                  evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them
                  using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring
                  trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies
                  a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for
                  much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show
                  that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on
                  nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for
                  autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing
                  sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or
                  diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance.
                  Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our
                  method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward
                  functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by
                  a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method
                  can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as
                  aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training
                  data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios
                  which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory

  abstract =     {Reconstructing 4D scenes from video inputs is a crucial yet
                  challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the
                  assumptions of multi-view video inputs, known camera
                  parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically
                  absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax
                  all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but
                  practical task, which we termed as AnyV4D: we assume only one
                  monocular video is available without any camera parameters as
                  input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside
                  the camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new
                  framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical
                  flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation,
                  entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time.
                  GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts,
                  then applies a sequential optimization process that optimizes
                  camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on
                  2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity among
                  neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since
                  dynamic scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a
                  new pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to
                  integrate new visual content. Moreover, GFlow transcends the
                  boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also enables tracking
                  of any points across frames without the need for prior
                  training and segments moving objects from the scene in an
                  unsupervised way. Additionally, the camera poses of each frame
                  can be derived from GFlow, allowing for rendering novel views
                  of a video scene through changing camera pose. By employing
                  the explicit representation, we may readily conduct
                  scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring
                  its versatility and power. Visit our project website at:

  abstract =     {While autonomous vehicles are vital components of intelligent
                  transportation systems, ensuring the trustworthiness of
                  decision-making remains a substantial challenge in realizing
                  autonomous driving. Therefore, we present a novel robust
                  reinforcement learning approach with safety guarantees to
                  attain trustworthy decision-making for autonomous vehicles.
                  The proposed technique ensures decision trustworthiness in
                  terms of policy robustness and collision safety. Specifically,
                  an adversary model is learned online to simulate the
                  worst-case uncertainty by approximating the optimal
                  adversarial perturbations on the observed states and
                  environmental dynamics. In addition, an adversarial robust
                  actor-critic algorithm is developed to enable the agent to
                  learn robust policies against perturbations in observations
                  and dynamics. Moreover, we devise a safety mask to guarantee
                  the collision safety of the autonomous driving agent during
                  both the training and testing processes using an interpretable
                  knowledge model known as the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety
                  model. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated through
                  both simulations and experiments. These results indicate that
                  the autonomous driving agent can make trustworthy decisions
                  and drastically reduce the number of collisions through robust
                  safety policies.}

  abstract =     {This paper considers the distributed data fusion (DDF) problem
                  for general multi-agent robotic sensor net-works in
                  applications such as 3D mapping and target search. In
                  particular, this paper focuses on the use of conservative
                  fusion via the weighted exponential product (WEP) rule to
                  combat inconsistencies that arise from double-counting common
                  information between fusion agents. WEP fusion is ideal for
                  fusing arbitrarily distributed estimates in ad-hoc
                  communication network topologies, but current WEP rule
                  variants have limited applicability to general multi-robot
                  DDF. To address these issues, new information-theoretic WEP
                  metrics are presented along with novel optimization algorithms
                  for efficiently performing DDF within a recursive Bayesian
                  estimation framework. While the proposed WEP fusion methods
                  are generalizable to arbitrary probability distribution
                  functions (pdfs), emphasis is placed here on widely-used
                  Bernoulli and Gaussian mixture pdfs. Experimental results for
                  multi-robot 3D mapping and target search applications show the
                  effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

                  the generalized distributive law (GDL). The GDL is a synthesis
                  of the work of many authors in information theory, digital
                  communications, signal processing, statistics and artificial
                  intelligence. It includes as special cases the Baum-Welch
                  algorithm, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on any finite
                  Abelian group, the Gallager-Tanner-Wiberg decoding algorithm,
                  Viterbi's algorithm, the BCJR algorithm, Pearl's "belief
                  propagation" algorithm, the Shafer-Shenoy probability
                  propagation algorithm, and the turbo decoding algorithm.
                  Although this algorithm is guaranteed to give exact answers
                  only in certain cases (the "junction tree" condition),
                  unfortunately not including the cases of GTW with cycles or
                  turbo decoding, there is much experimental evidence, and a few
                  theorems, suggesting that it often works approximately even

  title =        {Active vision},
  volume =       1,
  abstract =     {We investigate several basic problems in vision under the
                  assumption that the observer is active. An observer is called
                  active when engaged in some kind of activity whose purpose is
                  to control the geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus.
                  The purpose of the activity is to manipulate the constraints
                  underlying the observed phenomena in order to improve the
                  quality of the perceptual results. For example a monocular
                  observer that moves with a known or unknown motion or a
                  binocular observer that can rotate his eyes and track
                  environmental objects are just two examples of an observer
                  that we call active. We prove that an active observer can
                  solve basic vision problems in a much more efficient way than
                  a passive one. Problems that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a
                  passive observer become well-posed and linear for an active
                  observer. In particular, the problems of shape from shading
                  and depth computation, shape from contour, shape from texture,
                  and structure from motion are shown to be much easier for an
                  active observer than for a passive one. It has to be
                  emphasized that correspondence is not used in our approach,
                  i.e., active vision is not correspondence of features from
                  multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here does not mean
                  active sensing, and this paper introduces a general
                  methodology, a general framework in which we believe low-level
                  vision problems should be addressed.},

                  scene layout information for the control of locomotion.
                  Observers were presented displays simulating forward
                  locomotion through a random dot field with the horizontal
                  position perturbed by a sum-of-sines function and were asked
                  to steer and null out the horizontal disturbance of the path
                  of locomotion. The results indicate greater control gain and
                  accuracy when presented with a repeating layout of landmarks
                  as compared to a changing layout of landmarks. Debriefing
                  responses suggest that observers may have implicitly learned
                  the layout of the repeating pattern. These results suggest
                  that observers use an allocentric representation of the scene
                  for steering control. A model for the control of locomotion is
                  discussed that utilizes both scene-based information and optic

                  a situated activity and suggests that thinking beings ought

  abstract =     {We describe a probabilistic framework for detection and
                  modeling of doors from sensor data acquired in corridor
                  environments with mobile robots. The framework captures shape,
                  color, and motion properties of door and wall objects. The
                  probabilistic model is optimized with a version of the
                  expectation maximization algorithm, which segments the
                  environment into door and wall objects and learns their
                  properties. The framework allows the robot to generalize the
                  properties of detected object instances to new object
                  instances. We demonstrate the algorithm on real-world data
                  acquired by a Pioneer robot equipped with a laser range finder
                  and an omni-directional camera. Our results show that our
                  algorithm reliably segments the environment into walls and
                  doors, finding both doors that move and doors that do not
                  move. We show that our approach achieves better results than
                  models that only capture behavior, or only capture

                  synthesize a space-based optical interferometer, as envisioned
                  by the TPF mission of NASA Origins program, will allow for
                  baselines large enough to achieve milli-arcsecond resolutions.
                  We explore the use of the covariance intersection (CI)
                  algorithm for state estimation of distributed spacecraft. The
                  CI algorithm provides a mechanism for fusing two or more
                  random variables with unknown cross-covariance such that the
                  computed covariance of the new estimate is consistent. We
                  consider the case of five spacecraft with a decentralized
                  estimation scheme where each spacecraft shares its own
                  estimates with the rest of the fleet using a ring-type
                  communication architecture. This simplified scenario of the
                  TPF mission is used to highlight the problems that can
                  originate if the cross-covariances are completely ignored. The
                  result shows that the CI filter performance instead is not
                  affected and provides good estimates},

                  the periphery of its visual field. The developed method
                  combines the information acquired by this trinocular vision
                  system and produces low-level motor commands that keep the
                  robot in the middle of the free space. The approach follows
                  the purposive vision paradigm in the sense that vision is not
                  studied in isolation but in the context of the behaviors that
                  the system is engaged as well as the environment and the
                  robot's motor capabilities. It is demonstrated that by taking
                  into account these issues, vision processing can be
                  drastically simplified still giving rise to quite complex
                  behaviors. The proposed method does not make strict
                  assumptions about the environment, requires very low level
                  information to be extracted from the images, produces a robust
                  robot behavior and is computationally efficient. Results
                  obtained by bath simulations and from a prototype on-line
                  implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of the method},

                  learning maps of visual environments, but traditional
                  map-making techniques are inadequate in several respects. This
                  paper describes an adaptive, view-based, relational map-making
                  system for navigating within a 3D environment defined by a
                  spatially distributed set of visual landmarks. Inspired by an
                  analogy to learning aspect graphs of 3D objects, the system
                  comprises two neurocomputational architectures that emulate
                  cognitive mapping in the rat hippocampus. The first
                  architecture performs unsupervised place learning by combining
                  the ?hat?with the ?here? namely through conjunctions of
                  landmark identity, pose, and egocentric gaze direction within
                  a local, restricted sensory view of the environment. The
                  second associatively learns action consequences by
                  incorporating the ?hen? namely through conjunctions of learned
                  places and coarsely coded robot motions. Together, these
                  networks form a map reminiscent of a partially observable
                  Markov decision process, and consequently provide an ideal
                  neural substrate for prediction, environment recognition,
                  route planning, and exploration. Preliminary results from
                  real-time implementations on a mobile robot called MAVIN (the

  abstract =     {In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots obtain range
                  and/or angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning
                  information to help each other navigate more accurately. One
                  typical approach is moving baseline navigation, in which
                  multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) exchange range
                  measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile
                  trilateration. While the sharing of information between
                  vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements and
                  state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of
                  measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data
                  re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making
                  data association and outlier rejection more difficult and
                  divergence more likely. In this paper, we present a technique
                  for the consistent cooperative localization of multiple AUVs
                  performing mobile trilateration. Each AUV establishes a bank
                  of filters, performing careful bookkeeping to track the
                  origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the
                  measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are
                  combined in a consistent manner, yielding conservative
                  covariance estimates. The technique is illustrated using
                  simulation results. The new method is compared side-by-side
                  with a naive approach that does not keep track of the origins
                  of measurements, illustrating that the new method keeps
                  conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates
                  obtained with the naive approach become overconfident and
                  diverge.},

                  planar faces from multiple images of a scene. The novelty of
                  the approach lies in the use of inter-image homographies to
                  validate and best estimate the plane, and in the minimal
                  initialization requirements-only a single 3D line with a
                  textured neighbourhood is required to generate a plane
                  hypothesis. The planar facets enable line grouping and also
                  the construction of parts of the wireframe which were missed
                  due to the inevitable shortcomings of feature detection and
                  matching. The method allows a piecewise planar model of a
                  scene to be built completely automatically, with no user

  abstract =     {Active Perception (Active Vision specifically) is defined as a
                  study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By
                  modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and
                  their interaction. We distinguish local models from global
                  models by their extent of application in space and time. The
                  local models represent procedures and parameters such as
                  optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial
                  resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the
                  other hand characterize the overall performance and make
                  predictions on how the individual modules interact. The
                  control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence
                  of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is
                  seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the
                  existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from
                  focus and sterolvergence on 2-D segmentation of an image and

                  actively position the camera coordinate systemin response to
                  physical stimuli. Compared to passive systems, animate systems
                  show that visual computation can be vastly less expensive when
                  considered in the larger context of behavior. The most
                  important visual behavior is the ability to control the
                  direction of gaze. This allows the use of very low resolution
                  imaging that has a high virtual resolution. Using such a
                  system in a controlled way provides additional constraints
                  that dramatically simplify the computations of early vision.
                  Another important behavior is the way the environment
                  "behaves." Animate systems under real-time constraints can
                  further reduce their computational burden by using
                  environmental cues that are perspicuous in the local context.
                  A third source of economy is introduced when behaviors are
                  learned. Because errors are rarely fatal, systems using
                  learning algorithms can amortize computational cost over
                  extended periods. Further economies can be achieved when the
                  learning system uses indexical reference, which is a form of
                  dynamic variable binding. Animate vision is a natural way of
                  implementing this dynamic binding.},

  abstract =     {To ambulate in an urban environment, we face the management of
                  many simultaneous tasks, such as walking on a sidewalk,
                  avoiding pedestrians, and crossing busy streets. The
                  management of simultaneous tasks has been studied extensively,
                  but those studies tend to focus on attentional loading in
                  reaction time experiments that use stimulus presentations of
                  less than one second. As a result, little is known about how
                  attention is managed in extended natural tasks that take on
                  the order of many minutes. The current study addresses the
                  extended allocation of visual attention. We study the gaze
                  control and locomotion control for a virtual humanoid agent
                  walking in a realistic simulated urban world. The agent��?
                  behaviors are directed by visuo-motor routines that each
                  handle a single well-defined task, such as staying on the
                  sidewalk or avoiding an obstacle. The key element in our model
                  is that behaviors ask for and are given access to the body on
                  a probabilistic basis. The probabilities are continually
                  adjusted to reflect the contingencies produced by the
                  environment. The gaze access period is adjusted to reflect the
                  modal time of human fixations in similar tasks. The locomotion
                  access period is adjusted to fit human performance data. Such
                  a model can explain how different behaviors can compete for
                  both eye gaze resources in addition to locomotion resources of
                  the body in a seamless manner. In our simulation, the humanoid
                  walks along a crowded sidewalk and crosses streets. During
                  this time the instantaneous allocation of resources to gaze
                  and ambulation are recorded. To test our model, we have human
                  subjects doing the same task. Humans wear head-mounted
                  displays that allow them to navigate in the same virtual
                  environment. Six-dof head-tracking as well as eye-tracking in
                  the HMD allows us to compare the use of gaze and locomotion by
                  the human subjects with our model. Our initial results suggest
                  that the probabilistic allocation of resources is a good fit
                  to the human data.},

                  It is very important to mention the work of Barnard et. al. in
                  the context of automated annotation of images and scene
                  representation. {\textbackslash}citebarnard02 won the the best
                  paper award in Cognitive Vision at ECCV 2002. The goal of
                  their work is to attach words (annotations) to images and
                  image regions. The specialty is that they learn the joint
                  statistics of words and image regions from annotated training
                  images. After having learned the models, words can be attached
                  to images outside the training set (auto-annotation). The work
                  of Barnard et. al. is based on methods for modeling
                  co-occurrence data, especially the work of Hofmann and Puzicha
                  {\textbackslash}citehofmann98a. They developed a flat and
                  hierarchical models for dyadic (co-occurrence) data, that is
                  data that has associations of different types (e.g. image
                  features and image annotations).}

                  creation of 3D models of man-made environments that we
                  represent as collections of textured planes. A typical
                  approach is to automatically compute a sparse feature
                  reconstruction and to manually give their plane-memberships as
                  well as the delineation of the planes. Textures are then
                  extracted from the images while optimizing the model,
                  typically the disparity between marked and predicted edges. We
                  propose a means to automatically estimate the model of the
                  scene, in terms of the number of planes and their parameters
                  from a point feature reconstruction. The method is based on
                  random sampling of reconstructed points to generate plane
                  hypotheses. Each of these is then evaluated using a measure of
                  approximate photoconsistency while recovering the
                  corresponding plane delineation. We then compute the maximum
                  likelihood estimate of all scene parameters, i.e. the set of
                  planes and reconstructed points as well as relative camera
                  pose, with respect to actual images. The approach is validated

                  signposts for the robot to follow, thus obviating the need for
                  a map or localization on the part of the robot Navigation
                  directions are computed within the network (not on the robot)
                  using value iteration. Using small low-power radios, the robot
                  communicates with nodes in the network locally, and makes
                  navigation decisions based on which node it is near. An
                  algorithm based on processing of radio signal strength data

                  derived from an uncalibrated active vision system to navigate
                  an autonomous vehicle through free-space regions detected in a
                  cluttered environment. The structure of 3-space is recovered
                  modulo an affine transformation using an uncalibrated active
                  stereo head carried by the vehicle. The plane at infinity,
                  necessary for recovering affine structure from projective
                  structure, is found in a novel manner by making controlled
                  rotations of the head. The structure is composed of 3D points
                  obtained by detecting and matching image corners through the
                  stereo image sequence. Considerable care has been taken to
                  ensure that the processing is reliable, robust and automatic.
                  Driveable regions are determined from the projection of the
                  affine structure onto a plane parallel to the ground
                  determined using projective constructs. Two methods of
                  negotiating the regions are explored. The first introduces
                  metric information to allow control of a Euclidean vehicle.
                  The second uses visual servoing of the active head to navigate
                  in the affinely described free-space regions},

                  "acyclic" join dependency and a collection of functional

                  {Spatial} {Knowledge} using {Mobile} {Robots}},
  abstract =     {A map is a description of an environment allowing an agent—a
                  human, or in our case a mobile robot—to plan and perform
                  effective actions. From a single location, an agent's sensors
                  can not observe the whole structure of a complex, large
                  environment. For this reason, the agent must build a map from
                  observations gathered over time and space. We distinguish
                  between large-scale space, with spatial structure larger than
                  the agent's sensory horizon, and small-scale space, with
                  structure within the sensory horizon. We propose a factored
                  approach to mobile robot map-building that handles
                  qualitatively different types of uncertainty by combining the
                  strengths of topological and metrical approaches. Our
                  framework is based on a computational model of the human
                  cognitive map; thus it allows robust navigation and
                  communication within several different spatial ontologies. Our
                  approach factors the mapping problem into natural sub-goals:
                  building a metrical representation for local small-scale
                  spaces; finding a topological map that represents the
                  qualitative structure of large-scale space; and (when
                  necessary) constructing a metrical representation for
                  large-scale space using the skeleton provided by the
                  topological map. The core contributions of this thesis are a
                  formal description of the Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy
                  (HSSH), a framework for both small-scale and large-scale
                  representations of space, and an implementation of the HSSH
                  that allows a robot to ground the large-scale concepts of
                  place and path in a metrical model of the local surround.
                  Given metrical models of the robot's local surround, we argue
                  that places at decision points in the world can be grounded by
                  the use of a primitive called a gateway. Gateways separate
                  different regions in space and have a natural description at
                  intersections and in doorways. We provide an algorithmic
                  definition of gateways, a theory of how they contribute to the
                  description of paths and places, and practical uses of
                  gateways in spatial mapping and learning.},

                  robot-independent ontology and logical theory for building

                  SSH implementations make very limited use of perceptual
                  information and thus create many candidate maps. Metrical
                  mapping implementations capture detailed knowledge about local
                  small-scale space but do not handle large environments well
                  due to computational limitations and global metrical
                  uncertainty. In this paper, we extend the SSH to utilize

                  for partitioning the image array into low-level entities based
                  on a model of the underlying image structure. A
                  piecewise-smooth surface model for image data that possesses
                  surface coherence properties is used to develop an algorithm
                  that simultaneously segments a large class of images into
                  regions of arbitrary shape and approximates image data with
                  bivariate functions so that it is possible to compute a
                  complete, noiseless image reconstruction based on the
                  extracted functions and regions. Surface curvature sign
                  labeling provides an initial coarse image segmentation, which
                  is refined by an iterative region-growing method based on
                  variable-order surface fitting. Experimental results show the

  abstract =     {This paper introduces the deep coordination graph (DCG) for
                  collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning. DCG strikes
                  a flexible trade-off between representational capacity and
                  generalization by factoring the joint value function of all
                  agents according to a coordination graph into payoffs between
                  pairs of agents. The value can be maximized by local message
                  passing along the graph, which allows training of the value
                  function end-to-end with Q-learning. Payoff functions are
                  approximated with deep neural networks that employ parameter
                  sharing and low-rank approximations to significantly improve
                  sample efficiency. We show that DCG can solve predator-prey
                  tasks that highlight the relative overgeneralization
                  pathology, as well as challenging StarCraft II micromanagement

                  approach to SLAM that achieves efficient mapping of
                  large-scale environments. The representation is a graph of
                  coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing
                  a local frame, and each edge representing the transformation
                  between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that
                  captures the local environment and the current robot pose
                  along with the uncertainties of each. Each map? uncertainties
                  are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of
                  entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by
                  following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames,
                  computed via Dijkstra? shortest path algorithm. Loop closing
                  is achieved via an efficient map matching algorithm. We

  abstract =     {We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas
                  formed by M clauses of exactly K literals over N Boolean
                  variables. For a given value of N the problem is known to be
                  most difficult when {\textbackslash}alpha=M/N is close to the
                  experimental threshold {\textbackslash}alpha\_c separating the
                  region where almost all formulas are SAT from the region where
                  all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical
                  physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the
                  existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when α
                  is close to (but smaller than) {\textbackslash}alpha\_c. We
                  introduce a new type of message-passing algorithm which can be
                  used to find efficiently a satisfying assignment of the
                  variables in this difficult region. This algorithm is
                  iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a
                  message-passing procedure which generalizes the usual methods
                  like sum-product and belief propagation: It passes messages
                  that may be thought of as surveys over clusters of ordinary
                  messages. The second part uses the detailed probabilistic
                  information obtained from the surveys in order to fix
                  variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified
                  problem that remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.},

  abstract =     {The last half decade has seen a steep rise in the number of
                  contributions on safe learning methods for real-world robotic
                  deployments from both the control and reinforcement learning
                  communities. This article provides a concise but holistic
                  review of the recent advances made in using machine learning
                  to achieve safe decision-making under uncertainties, with a
                  focus on unifying the language and frameworks used in control
                  theory and reinforcement learning research. It includes
                  learning-based control approaches that safely improve
                  performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement
                  learning approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and
                  methods that can formally certify the safety of a learned
                  control policy. As data- and learning-based robot control
                  methods continue to gain traction, researchers must understand
                  when and how to best leverage them in real-world scenarios
                  where safety is imperative, such as when operating in close
                  proximityto humans. We highlight some of the open challenges
                  that will drive the field of robot learning in the coming
                  years, and emphasize the need for realistic physics-based
                  benchmarks to facilitate fair comparisons between control and
                  reinforcement learning approaches.},

  abstract =     {In this paper we consider the problem of exploring an unknown
                  environment by a team of robots. As in single-robot
                  exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration
                  time. The key problem to be solved therefore is to choose
                  appropriate target points for the individual robots so that
                  they simultaneously explore different regions of their
                  environment. We present a probabilistic approach for the
                  coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous
                  approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of
                  reaching a target point and the utility of target points. The
                  utility of target points is given by the size of the
                  unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon
                  reaching a target position. Whenever a target point is
                  assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored
                  area visible from this target position is reduced for the
                  other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns
                  different target points to the individual robots. The
                  technique has been implemented and tested extensively in
                  real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given
                  in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique
                  significantly reduces the exploration time compared to
                  previous approaches.},

                  localization and mapping (SLAM). We discuss it in the context

                  perception of a monocular camera using a minimum set of three
                  natural landmarks. In contrast to our previously presented
                  V-GPS system, which navigates based on a set of known
                  landmarks, the current approach allows to estimate the
                  required information about the landmarks on-the-fly during the
                  exploration of an unknown environment The method is applicable
                  to indoor and outdoor environments. The calculation is done
                  from the image position of a set of natural landmarks that are
                  tracked in a continuous video stream at frame-rate. An
                  automatic hand-off process allows an update of the set to
                  compensate for occlusions and decreasing reconstruction
                  accuracies with the distance to an imaged landmark. A generic
                  sensor model allows a system configuration with a variety of

                  the visual world, and to selectively gather information
                  critical to the task at hand. Computer vision systems must
                  follow similar smart sensing strategies if they are to perform

                  pyramid architecture, that supports smart sensing and related
                  highly efficient processing. Key elements of the design are a)
                  hierarchical data structures for image representation, b)
                  fine-to-coarse algorithms for the fast generation of image
                  measures, c) coarse-tofine search strategies that rapidly
                  locate objects or events within a scene, and d) high level
                  control mechanisms that guide data gathering even as visual
                  information is being interpreted. This system, known as the
                  Pyramid Vision Machine, achieves high performance at modest
                  cost. Design considerations and several applications are
                  described here.},

  abstract =     {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role
                  in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team
                  deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of
                  autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired
                  through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and
                  surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous
                  Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team
                  coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering
                  are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and
                  large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of
                  operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF)
                  have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the
                  problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of
                  robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict
                  assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior
                  knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present
                  paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case
                  of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses.
                  Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we
                  propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM
                  posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the
                  eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The
                  approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be
                  exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the
                  uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be
                  naturally extended to different communication technologies
                  (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range.
                  The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},

  volume =       57,
  abstract =     {Experiments by Fabre (1915), Thorpe (1950), Chmurzynski
                  (1964), and most recently Gould (1986) suggest that insects
                  have maps of their terrain which enable them to find their way
                  directly to a goal when they are displaced several hundred
                  metres from it. This paper discusses what might constitute an
                  insect's map in terms of a two-part computational model. The
                  first part describes how an insect reaches a goal when the
                  insect is sufficiently close that it can see some of the
                  landmarks which are visible from the goal. The second part
                  considers the problem of navigating when there is no
                  similarity between the view from the release-site and the view
                  from the goal. We start from a model designed to explain how a
                  bee might return to a goal using a two-dimensional snapshot of
                  the landscape seen from the goal (Collett and Cartwright
                  1983). To guide its return, the model bee continuously
                  compares its snapshot with its current retinal image and moves
                  so as to reduce the discrepancy between the two. Bees can only
                  be guided in the right direction by the difference between
                  current retinal image and snapshot when there is some
                  resemblance between the two. In a realistically cluttered
                  world, snapshot and retinal image become very dissimilar only
                  a short distance from the goal. To increase the distance from
                  which a model bee can return, the bee takes two snapshots at
                  the goal. The first snapshot excludes landmarks near to the
                  goal and the second snapshot includes them. With close
                  landmarks filtered from both snapshot and retinal image, the
                  match between the two deteriorates gradually as the bee moves
                  away from the goal. A model bee using a filtered snapshot and
                  image finds its way back to the neighbourhood of the goal from
                  a relatively long distance (Fig. 2). The bee then switches to
                  the second snapshot and is guided to the precise spot by its
                  memory of the close landmarks. For longer range guidance, the
                  model bee is equipped with an album of snapshots, each taken
                  at a different location within the terrain. Linked to each
                  snapshot is a vector encoding the distance and direction from
                  the place where the snapshot was taken to the hive. When the
                  bee is displaced to a new position, it selects the snapshot
                  which best matches its current image and follows the
                  associated home-vector back to the hive (Fig. 3). Such a
                  hive-centred map can also be used to devise novel routes to
                  places other than the hive. For instance, a bee can reach a
                  foraging site from anywhere in its terrain by adding the
                  home-vector recalled at the starting position to a vector
                  specifying the distance and direction of the foraging site
                  from the hive. The sum of these two vectors defines a direct
                  trajectory to the foraging site.},

  abstract =     {A distributed multitarget tracking problem is considered. The
                  joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, which
                  has been successfully used for tracking multiple targets in a
                  cluttered environment, assumes a centralized processing
                  architecture. It assumes that measurements are transmitted to
                  a central site and processed. In some applications, however,
                  it may be desirable for the sensor measurements to be
                  processed at or near the sensors instead of transmitting them
                  to the central processor. The local processed results are then
                  sent over a communication network to be used by other
                  processors. This paper presents a distributed version of the
                  JPDA algorithm which is applicable under such a situation.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a hybrid approach to the segmentation of
                  range images into planar regions. The term hybrid refers to a
                  combination of edge- and region-based considerations. A
                  reliable computational procedure which takes the range image
                  discontinuities into account is presented for computing the
                  pixel's normal. The segmentation algorithm consists of two
                  parts. In the first one, the pixels are aggregated according
                  to local properties derived from the input data and are
                  represented by a region adjacency graph (RAG). At this stage,
                  the image is still over-segmented. In the second part, the
                  segmentation is refined thanks to the construction of an
                  irregular pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the RAG
                  previously extracted. The over-segmented regions are merged
                  using a surface-based description. This algorithm has been
                  evaluated on 80 real images acquired by two different range
                  sensors using the methodology proposed in (Hoover et al.,
                  1996). Experimental results are presented and compared to

  abstract =     {We describe an algorithm for reconstructing three-dimensional
                  structure and motion causally, in real time from monocular
                  sequences of images. We prove that the algorithm is minimal
                  and stable, in the sense that the estimation error remains
                  bounded with probability one throughout a sequence of
                  arbitrary length. We discuss a scheme for handling occlusions
                  (point features appearing and disappearing) and drift in the
                  scale factor. These issues are crucial for the algorithm to
                  operate in real time on real scenes. We describe in detail the
                  implementation of the algorithm, which runs on a personal
                  computer and has been made available to the community. We
                  report the performance of our implementation on a few
                  representative long sequences of real and synthetic images.
                  The algorithm, which has been tested extensively over the
                  course of the past few years, exhibits honest performance when
                  the scene contains at least 20-40 points with high contrast,
                  when the relative motion is "slow" compared to the sampling
                  frequency of the frame grabber (30 Hz), and the lens aperture
                  is "large enough" (typically more than 30� of visual field)},

                  navigation using a wheels driven robot equipped with a
                  sonarray (an advanced sonar array). The original mapping
                  navigation experiment, carried out with the same robot
                  configuration, builds a feature map consisting of commonplace
                  indoor landmarks crucial for localisation, namely planes,
                  corners and edges. The map exhaustively maintains covariance
                  matrices among all features, thus presents a time and memory
                  impediment to practical navigation in large environments. The
                  new local mapping strategy proposed here breaks down a large
                  environment into a topology of local regions, only maintaining
                  the covariance among features in the same local region, and
                  the covariance among local maps. This notion of two hierarchy
                  representation drastically improves the memory and processing
                  time requirements of the original global approach, while
                  preserving the statistical details necessary for an accurate
                  map and prolonged navigation. The new local mapping scheme
                  also extends the endeavour towards reducing error accumulation
                  made in the global mapping strategy by eliminating totally
                  error accumulated between visits to the same part of an
                  environment. This is achieved with a map matching strategy
                  developed exclusively for the advanced sonar sensor employed.
                  The local mapping strategy has been tested in large, real life
                  indoor environments and successful results are reported here.},

  volume =       17,
  abstract =     {One of the critical components of mapping an unknown
                  environment is the robot? ability to locate itself on a
                  partially explored map. This becomes challenging when the
                  robot experiences positioning error, does not have an external
                  positioning device, nor the luxury of engineered landmarks
                  placed in its free space. This paper presents a new method for
                  simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits the
                  topology of the robot? free space to localize the robot on a
                  partially constructed map. The topology of the environment is
                  encoded in a topological map; the particular topological map
                  used in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG),
                  which also encodes some metric information about the robot?
                  environment, as well. In this paper, we present the low-level
                  control laws that generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby
                  allowing for exploration of an unknown space. With these
                  prescribed control laws, the GVG (or other topological map)
                  can be viewed as an arbitrator for a hybrid control system
                  that determines when to invoke a particular low-level
                  controller from a set of controllers all working toward the
                  high-level capability of mobile robot exploration. The main
                  contribution, however, is using the graph structure of the
                  GVG, via a graph matching process, to localize the robot.

  abstract =     {We consider the following problem: a team of robots is
                  deployed in an unknown environment and it has to
                  collaboratively build a map of the area without a reliable
                  infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern
                  mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates
                  the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily
                  built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of
                  distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather
                  than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server,
                  the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to
                  reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our
                  approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of
                  a two-stage approach that already exists, where we use the
                  Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation as
                  workhorses to split the computation among the robots. We also
                  provide conditions under which the proposed distributed
                  protocols converge to the solution of the centralized
                  two-stage approach. As a second contribution, we extend the
                  proposed distributed algorithms to work with the object-based
                  map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange
                  of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point clouds or RGB-D data)
                  further reducing the communication burden. Our third
                  contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the
                  proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo
                  simulations and field experiments in a military test facility.
                  Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the
                  proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss–Seidel method) has
                  excellent performance. The Distributed Gauss–Seidel method
                  requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor,
                  scales well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a team
                  of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy to implement.
                  Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed
                  algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication
                  requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables
                  distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world
                  problems. The source code is available for download at

                  n-dimensional discrete probability distribution by a product

                  first-order tree dependence. The problem is to find an optimum
                  set of n-1 first order dependence relationship among the n
                  variables. It is shown that the procedure derived in this
                  paper yields an approximation of a minimum difference in
                  information. It is further shown that when this procedure is
                  applied to empirical observations from an unknown distribution
                  of tree dependence, the procedure is the maximum-likelihood

                  {Towards} a unified theory of cognitive mapping},
  volume =       19,
  abstract =     {An integrated representation of large-scale space, or
                  cognitive map, colled PLAN, is presented that attempts to
                  address a broader spectrum of issues than has been previously
                  attempted in a single model. Rather than examining way-finding
                  as a process separate from the rest of cognition, one or the
                  fundamental goals of this work is to examine how the
                  wayfinding process is integrated into general cognition. One
                  result of this approach is that the model is ?eads-up? or
                  scene-based, because it takes advantage of the properties of
                  the human visual system and, particularly, the visual system's
                  split into two pathways. The emphasis on the human location or
                  ?here?system is new to cognitive mapping and is port of an
                  attempt to synthesize prototype theory, associative networks
                  and location together in a connectionist system. Not all of
                  PLAN is new, however. Many of its parts have analogues in one
                  or another preexisting theory. What makes PLAN unique is
                  integrating the various components into a coherent whole, and
                  the capacity of this resulting system to speak to a wide range
                  of constraints. Our approach emphasizes adaptiveness; thus,
                  our focus on such issues as ease of use and efficiency of
                  learning. The result is a model that has a stronger
                  relationship both to the environment, and to the ways that
                  humans interact with it, compared with previous models. The
                  resulting model is examined in some detail and compared to
                  other systems.},

                  uncalibrated images of architectural scenes. We propose a
                  simple, geometrically intuitive method which exploits the
                  strong rigidity constraints of parallelism and orthogonality
                  present in indoor and outdoor architectural scenes. We show
                  how these simple constraints can be used to calibrate the
                  cameras and to recover the projection matrices for each
                  viewpoint. The projection matrices are used to recover partial
                  3D models of the scene and these can be used to visualise new
                  viewpoints. Our approach does not need any a priori
                  information about the cameras being used. A working system
                  called PhotoBuilder had been designed and implemented to allow
                  a user to interactively build a VRML model of a building from
                  uncalibrated images from arbitrary viewpoints.},

  volume =       24,
  abstract =     {We present a new parametrization for point fea- tures within
                  monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that
                  permits efficient and accurate representation of un- certainty
                  during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within the
                  standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept is
                  direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features rela-
                  tive to the camera locations from which they were first
                  viewed, which produces measurement equations with a high
                  degree of linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features over a huge range of depths, even those that are
                  so far from the cam- era that they present little parallax
                  during motion—maintaining sufficient representative
                  uncertainty that these points retain the op- portunity to
                  “come in” smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger
                  movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense
                  that even distant features are immediately used to improve
                  cam- era motion estimates, acting initially as bearing
                  references but not permanently labeled as such. The inverse
                  depth parametrization remains well behaved for features at all
                  stages of SLAM process- ing, but has the drawback in
                  computational terms that each point is represented by a 6-D
                  state vector as opposed to the standard three of a Euclidean
                  XYZ representation. We show that once the depth estimate of a
                  feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation can
                  safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a
                  linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion

  abstract =     {This paper presents a method for Simultaneous Localization and
                  Mapping (SLAM) relying on a monocular camera as the only
                  sensor, which is able to build outdoor, closed-loop maps much
                  larger than previously achieved with such input. Our system,
                  based on the Hierarchical Map approach by Estrada et al.
                  (2005), builds independent local maps in real-time using the
                  EKF-SLAM technique and the inverse depth representation
                  proposed by Montiel et al. (2006). The main novelty in the
                  local mapping process is the use of a data association
                  technique that greatly improves its robustness in dynamic and
                  complex environments. A new visual map matching algorithm
                  stitches these maps together and is able to detect large loops
                  automatically, taking into account the unobservability of
                  scale intrinsic to pure monocular SLAM. The loop closing
                  constraint is applied at the upper level of the Hierarchical
                  Map in near real-time. We present experimental results
                  demonstrating monocular SLAM as a human carries a camera over
                  long walked trajectories in outdoor areas with people and
                  other clutter, even in the more difficult case of
                  forward-looking camera, and show the closing of loops of

  volume =       2,
  abstract =     {In this paper, an absolute localization paradigm based on the
                  cooperation of an omnidirectional vision system composed of a
                  conical mirror and a CCD camera and a low cost panoramic range
                  finder system is reported. These two sensors, which have been
                  used independently until now, provide some complementary data.
                  This association enables us to build a robust sensorial model
                  which integrates an important number of significant
                  primitives. We can thus realize an absolute localization of
                  the mobile robot in particular configurations, like symmetric
                  environments, where it is not possible to determine the
                  position with the use of only one of the two sensors. In a
                  first part, we present our global perception system. In a
                  second part, we describe our sensorial model building
                  approach. Finally we present an absolute localization method
                  which uses three matching criteria fused thanks to the
                  combination rules of the Dempster-Shafer theory. The basic
                  probability assignment got for each primitive matching enables
                  to estimate the reliability of the localization. We test our
                  global absolute localization system on several robots'
                  elementary moves in an indoor and symmetric environment},

                  information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of
                  users at terminals and most application programs should remain
                  unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
                  and even when some aspects of the external representation are
                  changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed
                  as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic

  abstract =     {Background subtraction methods are widely exploited for moving
                  object detection in videos in many applications, such as
                  traffic monitoring, human motion capture, and video
                  surveillance. How to correctly and efficiently model and
                  update the background model and how to deal with shadows are
                  two of the most distinguishing and challenging aspects of such
                  approaches. This work proposes a general-purpose method that
                  combines statistical assumptions with the object- level
                  knowledge of moving objects, apparent objects (ghosts), and
                  shadows acquired in the processing of the previous frames.
                  Pixels belonging to moving objects, ghosts, and shadows are
                  processed differently in order to supply an object-based
                  selective update. The proposed approach exploits color
                  information for both background subtraction and shadow
                  detection to improve object segmentation and background
                  update. The approach proves fast, flexible, and precise in
                  terms of both pixel accuracy and reactivity to background

  abstract =     {Video-surveillance and traffic analysis systems can be heavily
                  improved using vision-based techniques able to extract, manage
                  and track objects in the scene. However, problems arise due to
                  shadows. In particular, moving shadows can affect the correct
                  localization, measurements and detection of moving objects.
                  This work aims to present a technique for shadow detection and
                  suppression used in a system for moving visual object
                  detection and tracking. The major novelty of the shadow
                  detection technique is the analysis carried out in the HSV
                  color space to improve the accuracy in detecting shadows.
                  Signal processing and optic motivations of the approach
                  proposed are described. The integration and exploitation of
                  the shadow detection mod- ule into the system are outlined and

  abstract =     {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem
                  of recognizing places based on their appearance. The system we
                  present is not limited to localization, but can determine that
                  a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so
                  augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the
                  space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to
                  explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the
                  environment–identical but indistinctive observations receive a
                  low probability of having come from the same place. We achieve
                  this by learning a generative model of place appearance. By
                  partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place
                  models can be learned online from only a single observation of
                  a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of
                  places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online
                  loop closure detection in mobile robotics.

                  matrices. There is a direct correspondence between the

                  environment while simultaneously having to determine its
                  location within that map, is one of the current fundamental
                  challenges of robotics. Although a great deal of success has
                  been achieved with laser range finders as sensors and a planar
                  world assumption, low-cost commercial robots will benefit from
                  robust SLAM using cameras only. Towards the goal of a robust,
                  six degree-of-freedom, vision-based SLAM algorithm, we
                  describe the application of "FastSLAM" [1] to the problem of
                  estimating a map from observations of 3D line segments using a
                  trinocular stereo camera rig. By maintaining not only multiple
                  hypotheses about the robot's position in space, but also
                  maintaining multiple maps corresponding to those possible
                  position hypothesis, the algorithm has the potential to
                  overcome the systematic map errors induced by incorrect
                  correspondence estimation.},

  abstract =     {In the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, a
                  mobile robot must build a map of its environment while
                  simultaneously determining its location within that map. We
                  propose a new algorithm, for visual SLAM (VSLAM), in which the
                  robot? only sensory information is video imagery. Our approach
                  combines stereo vision with a popular sequential Monte Carlo
                  (SMC) algorithm, the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, to
                  simultaneously explore multiple hypotheses about the robot?
                  six degree-of-freedom trajectory through space and maintain a
                  distinct stochastic map for each of those candidate
                  trajectories. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in
                  mapping a large outdoor virtual reality environment in the
                  presence of odometry error.},

                  Accurately characterizing the neurophysiology of surgeons
                  during intraoperative error will help guide more accurate
                  performance assessment and precision training for surgeons and
                  other teleoperators. To better understand the neurophysiology

                  intraoperative error detection and electroencephalography

  abstract =     {We introduce an any-space algorithm for exact inference in
                  Bayesian networks, called recursive conditioning. On one
                  extreme, recursive conditioning takes O(n) space and
                  O(nexp(wlogn)) time - where n is the size of a Bayesian
                  network and w is the width of a given elimination order -
                  therefore, establishing a new complexity result for
                  linear-space inference in Bayesian networks. On the other
                  extreme, recursive conditioning takes O(nexp(w)) space and
                  O(nexp(w)) time, therefore, matching the complexity of
                  state-of-the-art algorithms based on clustering and
                  elimination. In between linear and exponential space,
                  recursive conditioning can utilize memory at increments of
                  X-bytes, where X is the number of bytes needed to store a
                  floating point number in a cache. Moreover, the algorithm is
                  equipped with a formula for computing its average running time
                  under any amount of space, hence, providing a valuable tool
                  for time-space tradeoffs in demanding applications. Recursive
                  conditioning is therefore the first algorithm for exact
                  inference in Bayesian networks to offer a smooth tradeoff
                  between time and space, and to explicate a smooth,
                  quantitative relationship between these two important

                  mobile robots has focused on the simplified case in which a
                  robot is considered to move in two dimensions on a ground
                  plane. While this is often a good approximation, a large
                  number of real-world applications require robots to move
                  around terrain which has significant slopes and undulations,
                  and it is desirable that these robots too should be able to

                  develop models for the motion of a wheeled robot in the

                  implementation, our robot observes visual point features using
                  fixating stereo vision and builds a sparse map on-the-fly.
                  Combining this visual measurement with information from
                  odometry and a roll/pitch accelerometer sensor, the robot
                  performs accurate, repeatable localisation while traversing an

  abstract =     {This paper demonstrates an approach which exploits an active
                  camera as a projective pointing mechanism. The optical centre
                  of a static camera is notionally substituted by the centre of
                  rotation of the active camera, as is the image plane by a
                  frontal plane, a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of
                  the active camera in its resting direction. Algorithms devised
                  for 3D motion and 3D structure recovery using a single passive
                  camera become immediately applicable to the active camera
                  without need for reformulation. Furthermore, because the
                  active camera can access a panoramic field of view,
                  instabilities which may arise when the field of view is small,
                  or because the shared field of view between successive views
                  after movement is small, are lessened. Two quite different
                  applications of the idea are presented. In the first, the
                  homography between a planar surface in the scene and the
                  frontal plane is recovered and used to recover scene
                  trajectories. In the second, the essential matrix between
                  points in two frontal-plane "views" is recovered and used to

  abstract =     {In most cases when information is to be extracted from an
                  image, there are priors available on the state of the world
                  and therefore on the detailed measurements which will be
                  obtained. While such priors are commonly combined with the
                  actual measurements via Bayes?rule to calculate posterior
                  probability distributions on model parameters, their
                  additional value in guiding efficient image processing has
                  almost always been overlooked. Priors tell us where to look
                  for information in an image, how much computational effort we
                  can expect to expend to extract it, and of how much utility to
                  the task in hand it is likely to be. Such considerations are
                  of importance in all practical real-time vision systems, where
                  the processing resources available at each frame in a sequence
                  are strictly limited ?and it is exactly in high frame-rate
                  real-time systems such as trackers where strong priors are
                  most likely to be available. In this paper, we use Shannon
                  information theory to analyse the fundamental value of
                  measurements using mutual information scores in absolute units
                  of bits, specifically looking at the overwhelming case where
                  uncertainty can be characterised by Gaussian probability
                  distributions. We then compare these measurement values with
                  the computational cost of the image processing required to
                  obtain them. This theory puts on a firm footing for the first
                  time principles of ?ctive search?for efficient guided image
                  processing, in which candidate features of possibly different
                  types can be compared and selected automatically for

                  trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a
                  previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM,
                  is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology
                  from mobile robotics to the ?ure vision?domain of a single
                  uncontrolled camera, achieving real-time but drift-free
                  performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches.
                  The core of the approach is the on-line creation of a sparse
                  but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic
                  framework. Our key novel contributions include an active
                  approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general
                  motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for
                  monocular feature initialization and feature orientation

                  and robust algorithm which runs at 30Hz with standard PC and
                  camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic
                  systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens

                  which most successful structure from motion work has been
                  achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from
                  measurements of a continuously expanding set of selfmapped
                  visual features is one of a class of problems known as
                  Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics
                  community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research,
                  despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than
                  off-line structure from motion methods due to the more
                  fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We
                  present a top-down Bayesian framework for singlecamera
                  localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features
                  using motion modelling and an informationguided active

                  issue of real-time feature initialisation via a factored
                  sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits
                  robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of
                  a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited
                  after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through

                  wide-angle optics provide a field of view greater than the 40

                  issue is one of feature contact: each landmark object mapped
                  remains visible through a larger range of camera motion,
                  meaning that feature density can be reduced and camera
                  movement range can be increased. Further, localisation

                  problematic because appearance can vary widely depending on
                  illumination, viewing distance, angle of view and so on.
                  Storing a separate image or `template' for every possible view
                  requires vast numbers to be stored and scanned, has a high
                  probability of recognition error and appears not to be the
                  solution adopted by primates. However, some invertebrate
                  template matching systems can achieve recognition by `active
                  vision' in which the animal's own behaviour is used to achieve
                  a fit between template and object, for example by repeatedly
                  following a set path. Recognition is thus limited to views
                  from the set path but achieved with a minimal number of
                  templates. Here we report the first evidence of similar active
                  vision in a bird, in the form of locomotion and individually
                  distinct head movements that give the eyes a similar series of
                  views on different occasions. The hens' ability to recognize

                  adaptive-consistency for constraint satisfaction, Fourier and
                  Gaussian elimination for solving linear equalities and
                  inequalities, and dynamic programming for combinatorial

                  elimination framework. Many probabilistic in- ference tasks
                  can likewise be expressed as bucket-elimination algorithms.
                  These include: belief updating, finding the most probable

                  interaction graph. While elimination strategies have extensive
                  demands on memory, a contrasting class of algorithms called
                  "conditioning search" require only linear space. Algorithms in
                  this class split a problem into subproblems by instantiating a
                  subset of variables, called a conditioning set, or a cutset.
                  Typical examples of conditioning search algorithms are:
                  backtracking (in constraint satisfaction), and branch and

                  probabilistic and deterministic reasoning tasks and show how

  abstract =     {This article presents a class of approximation algorithms that
                  extend the idea of bounded-complexity inference, inspired by
                  successful constraint propagation algorithms, to probabilistic
                  inference and combinatorial optimization. The idea is to bound
                  the dimensionality of dependencies created by inference
                  algorithms. This yields a parameterized scheme, called
                  mini-buckets, that offers adjustable trade-off between
                  accuracy and efficiency. The mini-bucket approach to
                  optimization problems, such as finding the most probable
                  explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks, generates both an
                  approximate solution and bounds on the solution quality. We
                  present empirical results demonstrating successful performance
                  of the proposed approximation scheme for the MPE task, both on
                  randomly generated problems and on realistic domains such as
                  medical diagnosis and probabilistic decoding.},

  abstract =     {Many estimation, planning, and optimal control problems in
                  robotics have an optimization problem at their core. In most
                  of these optimization problems, the objective to be maximized
                  or minimized is composed of many different factors or terms
                  that are local in nature—that is, they depend only on a small
                  subset of the variables. A particularly insightful way of
                  modeling this locality structure is to use the concept of
                  factor graphs, a bipartite graphical model in which factors
                  represent functions on subsets of variables. Factor graphs can
                  represent a wide variety of problems across robotics, expose
                  opportunities to improve computational performance, and are
                  beneficial in designing and thinking about how to model a
                  problem, even aside from performance considerations. I discuss
                  each of these three aspects in detail and review several
                  state-of-the-art robotics applications in which factor graphs

  abstract =     {QR factorization is most often used as a black box algorithm,
                  but is in fact an elegant computation on a factor graph. By
                  computing a rooted clique tree on this graph, the computation
                  can be parallelized across subtrees, which forms the basis of
                  so-called multifrontal QR methods. By judiciously choosing the
                  order in which variables are eliminated in the clique tree
                  computation, we show that one straightforwardly obtains a
                  method for performing inference in distributed sensor
                  networks. One obvious application is distributed localization
                  and mapping with a team of robots. We phrase the problem as
                  inference on a large-scale Gaussian Markov Random Field

  abstract =     {Solving the SLAM problem is one way to enable a robot to
                  explore, map, and navigate in a previously unknown
                  environment. We investigate smoothing approaches as a viable
                  alternative to extended Kalman filter-based solutions to the
                  problem. In particular, we look at approaches that factorize
                  either the associated information matrix or the measurement
                  Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several
                  significant advantages over the EKF: they are faster yet
                  exact, they can be used in either batch or incremental mode,
                  are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and
                  measurement models, and yield the entire robot trajectory, at
                  lower cost for a large class of SLAM problems. In addition, in
                  an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics
                  automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic
                  nature of the SLAM problem. In this paper we present the
                  theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation
                  of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated
                  with the SLAM problem. We present both simulation results and
                  actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments that
                  underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to
                  EKF-based approaches.},

                  realism of coarse piecewise planar models from an uncalibrated
                  sequence of images. First, dense depth maps are estimated by
                  aligning a planar region of a scene in each image,
                  approximating camera calibration, and generating dense planar
                  parallax. These depth maps are then robustly fused to obtain
                  incrementally refined surface estimates. It is envisaged that
                  this system will extend the modelling capability of existing
                  systems [Cipolla99icmcs] which generate simple, piecewise
                  planar architectural models.},

                  for a monocular camera system mounted on an underactuated
                  wheeled mobile robot (WMR) subject to nonholonomic motion
                  constraints (i.e., the camera-in-hand problem). A prerecorded
                  image sequence (e.g., a video) of three target points is used
                  to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By comparing the
                  target points from a stationary reference image with the
                  corresponding target points in the live image and the
                  prerecorded sequence of images, projective geometric
                  relationships are exploited to construct Euclidean
                  homographies. The information obtained by decomposing the
                  Euclidean homography is used to develop a kinematic
                  controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to develop an
                  adaptive update law to actively compensate for the lack of
                  depth information required for the translation error system.

  volume =       132,
  abstract =     {The idea of synthesizing bounded length plans by compiling
                  planning problems into a combinatorial substrate, and solving
                  the resulting encodings has become quite popular in recent
                  years. Most work to-date has however concentrated on
                  compilation to satisfiability (SAT) theories and integer
                  linear programming (ILP). In this paper we will show that CSP
                  is a better substrate for the compilation approach, compared
                  to both SAT and ILP. We describe GP-CSP, a system that does
                  planning by automatically converting Graphplan's planning
                  graph into a CSP encoding and solving it using standard CSP
                  solvers. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation of GP-CSP
                  demonstrates that it is superior to both the Blackbox system,
                  which compiles planning graphs into SAT encodings, and an
                  ILP-based planner in a wide range of planning domains. Our
                  results show that CSP encodings outperform SAT encodings in
                  terms of both space and time requirements in various problems.
                  The space reduction is particularly important as it makes
                  GP-CSP less susceptible to the memory blow-up associated with
                  SAT compilation methods. The paper also discusses various
                  techniques in setting up the CSP encodings, planning specific
                  improvements to CSP solvers, and strategies for variable and
                  value selection heuristics for solving the CSP encodings of
                  different types of planning problems.},

  abstract =     {The undirected technique for evaluating belief networks
                  [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988]
                  requires clustering the nodes in the network into a junction
                  tree. In the traditional view, the junction tree is
                  constructed from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated
                  belief network: triangulation is taken to be the primitive
                  concept, the goal towards which any clustering algorithm (e.g.
                  node elimination) is directed. In this paper, we present an
                  alternative conception of clustering, in which clusters and
                  the junction tree property play the role of primitives: given
                  a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a modified
                  version of) the junction tree property, we transform this
                  graph until we have obtained a tree. There are several
                  advantages to this approach: it is much clearer and easier to
                  understand, which is important for humans who are constructing

                  is proposed, emphasizing two distinct uses of fuzzy sets:
                  representing preference profiles and modelling uncertainty
                  distributions. The first setting leads to a valued,
                  noncompensatory generalization of constraint-directed
                  scheduling. The other setting yields a possibility-theoretic
                  counterpart of PERT, where probability distributions of
                  activity durations are changed into possibility distributions,
                  for the purpose of modelling incomplete information. It is
                  pointed out that a special case of the latter, interval-valued
                  PERT, is a difficult, ill-known problem, regarding the
                  determination of critical activities, latest starting times
                  and floats. Lastly when flexible constraints and uncertain
                  processing times are to be jointly considered, the use of
                  possibilistic decision theory leads to the computation of
                  robust schedules.},

  abstract =     {Mobile robots require the ability to build their own maps to
                  operate in unknown environments. A fundamental problem is that
                  odometry-based dead reckoning cannot be used to assign
                  accurate global position information to a map because of drift
                  errors caused by wheel slippage. This paper introduces a fast,
                  on-line method of learning globally consistent maps, using
                  only local metric information. The approach differs from
                  previous work in that it is computationally cheap, easy to
                  implement and is guaranteed to find a globally optimal
                  solution. Experiments are presented in which large, complex
                  environments were successfully mapped by a real robot, and
                  quantitative performance measures are used to assess the
                  quality of the maps obtained.},

                  world, where no distance or orientation metric is assumed of
                  the world. The robot is assumed to be able to autonomously
                  traverse graph edges, recognize when it has reached a vertex,
                  and enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex relative
                  to the edge via which it entered the current vertex. The robot
                  cannot measure distances, and it does not have a compass. It
                  is demonstrated that this exploration problem is unsolvable in
                  general without markers, and, to solve it, the robot is
                  equipped with one or more distinct markers that can be put
                  down or picked up at will and that can be recognized by the
                  robot if they are at the same vertex as the robot. An
                  exploration algorithm is developed and proven correct. Its
                  performance is shown on several example worlds, and heuristics
                  for improving its performance are discussed.},

  volume =       15,
  abstract =     {Neurons in the dorsal region of the medial superior temporal
                  area (MSTd) have previously been shown to respond to the
                  expanding radial motion that occurs as an observer moves
                  through the environment. In previous experiments, MSTd neurons
                  were tested with radial and circular motion centered in the
                  visual field. However, different directions of observer
                  motion, relative to the direction of gaze, are accompanied by
                  visual motion centered at different locations in the visual
                  field. The present experiments investigated whether neurons
                  that respond to radial and circular motion might respond
                  differently when the center of motion was shifted to different
                  regions of the visual field. About 90\% of the 245 neurons
                  studied responded differently when the center of motion was
                  shifted away from the center of the field. The centers of
                  motion preferred by each neuron were limited to one area of
                  the visual field. All parts of the visual field were
                  represented in the sample, with greater numbers of neurons
                  preferring centers of motion closer to the center of the
                  field. We hypothesize that each of the MSTd neurons has a
                  center of motion field with a gradient of preferred centers of
                  motion, and that there is an orderly arrangement of MSTd
                  neurons with each region of the visual field being represented
                  by a set of neurons. This arrangement creates the potential
                  for graded responses from individual neurons for different
                  directions of heading as an observer moves through the
                  environment.},

                  of data fusion methods appropriate to networks of
                  decentralised sensors and the practical implementation of
                  these in both civilian and military contexts. The methods
                  employed for studying the decentralized data fusion problem
                  are based on the information-filter formulation of the Kalman
                  filter algorithm and on information-theoretic methods derived
                  from Bayes theorem. This theory is briefly described in
                  context of a number of practical implementations of
                  decentralised data fusion methods in surveillance and control
                  applications. The paper describes specific theoretical tools
                  developed to address such issues as; decentralised
                  communication management, model distribution, decentralised
                  data association and fault detection, sensor control
                  (information gathering, target cuing and hand-off),
                  decentralised picture compilation and map building. Finally,
                  we describe our current work deployment of decentralized,
                  large-scale systems of systems demonstrations.},

                  Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) and the extensive research on
                  SLAM that has been undertaken over the past decade. SLAM is
                  the process by which a mobile robot can build a map of an
                  environment and at the same time use this map to compute it's
                  own location. The past decade has seen rapid and exciting
                  progress in solving the SLAM problem together with many
                  compelling implementations of SLAM methods. Part I of this
                  tutorial (this paper), describes the probabilistic form of the
                  SLAM problem, essential solution methods and significant
                  implementations. Part II of this tutorial will be concerned

  abstract =     {A fully decentralized architecture is presented for data
                  fusion problems. This architecture takes the form of a network
                  of sensor nodes, each with its own processing facility, which
                  together do not require any central processor or any central
                  communication facility. In this architecture, computation is
                  performed locally and communication occurs between any two
                  nodes. Such an architecture has many desirable properties,
                  including robustness to sensors failure and flexibility to the
                  addition or loss of one or more sensors. This architecture is
                  appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter
                  (EKF)-based geometric data fusion problems. The starting point
                  for this architecture is an algorithm which allows the
                  complete decentralization of the multisensor EKF equations
                  among a number of sensing nodes. This algorithm is described,
                  and it is shown how it can be applied to a number of different

                  problem of multicamera, real-time tracking of objects and
                  people moving through a room is described},

                  actual position by rotational or translational components.
                  Theoretical issues addressed were whether spatial relations
                  stored in an object-to-object system are directly retrieved or
                  whether retrieval is mediated by a bodycentered coordinate
                  system, and whether body-centered access involves a process of
                  imaging updating of self-position. The results, with those of
                  Rieser (1989), indicate that in the case of regularly
                  structured object arrays, interobject relations are directly
                  retrieved for the translation task, but for the rotation task,
                  retrieval occurs by means of a body-centered coordinate

  volume =       9,
  abstract =     {A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid
                  body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which
                  correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented
                  here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which
                  computes the translational and rotational components of the
                  transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares
                  formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the
                  transformation representation used and the mathematical
                  derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value
                  decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard
                  representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices
                  derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform.
                  This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative
                  results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the
                  accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of
                  different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to
                  degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of
                  each approach under different conditions. The results indicate
                  that under �ideal� data conditions (no noise) certain
                  distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for
                  �typical, real-world� noise levels, there is no difference in
                  the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain
                  previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of
                  execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the
                  computer system setup.},

                  moving regions in image sequences taken from a static camera
                  by comparing each new frame to a model of the scene
                  background. We present a novel non-parametric background model
                  and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle
                  situations where the back- ground of the scene is cluttered
                  and not completely static but contains small motions such as
                  tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability
                  of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of
                  intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to
                  changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of
                  moving targets. We also show how the model can use color
                  information to suppress detec- tion of shadows. The
                  implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray
                  level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach

                  addressing the basic problems of robot localization and
                  mapping and they have shown great promise on the combined
                  problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). One
                  approach to SLAM assumes relatively sparse, relatively
                  unambiguous landmarks and builds a Kalman filter over landmark
                  positions. Other approaches assume dense sensor data which
                  individually are not very distinctive, such as those available
                  from a laser range finder. In earlier work, we presented an
                  algorithm called DP-SLAM, which provided a very accurate
                  solution to the latter case by efficiently maintaining a joint
                  distribution over robot maps and poses. The approach assumed
                  an extremely accurate laser range finder and a deterministic
                  environment. In this work we demonstrate an improved map
                  representation and laser penetration model, an improvement in
                  the asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm, and empirical

                  (RBPF) for the class of indoor mobile robots equipped only
                  with stereo vision. Our goal is to construct dense metric maps
                  of natural 3D point landmarks for large cyclic environments in
                  the absence of accurate landmark position measurements and
                  motion estimates. Our work differs from other approaches
                  because landmark estimates are derived from stereo vision and
                  motion estimates are based on sparse optical flow. We
                  distinguish between landmarks using the Scale Invariant
                  Feature Transform (SIFT). This is in contrast to current
                  popular approaches that rely on reliable motion models derived
                  from odometric hardware and accurate landmark measurements
                  obtained with laser sensors. Since our approach depends on a
                  particle filter whose main component is the proposal
                  distribution, we develop and evaluate a novel mixture proposal
                  distribution that allows us to robustly close large loops. We

                  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem (SLAM). We focus
                  on robots equipped with stereo vision and develop a SLAM
                  solution based on the theory of the Rao-Blackwellised particle
                  filter (RBPF). We refer to our method as σSLAM. We construct
                  maps of 3D point-landmarks identified by their visual
                  appearance. Specifically, we use the Scale Invariant Feature
                  Transform (SIFT) for distinguishing among the thousands of
                  landmarks present in the robot? environment. Our particle
                  filter approach utilizes a mixture proposal distribution and
                  accurately tracks the position of the robot and the landmarks
                  over long trajectories. In addition, we do not depend on robot
                  odometry in the particle filter? proposal mechanism; instead,
                  we develop a proposal distribution that relies on visual
                  odometry easing the transition towards a SLAM solution for
                  robots performing 3D motion. Most importantly, σSLAM works in
                  near real-time making it applicable for use with mobile robots
                  today. Moreover, we show that we can construct 2D
                  occupancy-grid maps from stereo vision; these are useful for
                  path planning and obstacle avoidance. Finally, we validate our

                  fragments between two strings, and to predict RNA secondary
                  structure, are considered. These recurrences are defined over
                  a number of points that is quadratic in the input size;
                  however, only a sparse set matters for the result. Efficient
                  algorithms are given for solving these problems, when the cost
                  of a gap in the alignment or a loop in the secondary structure
                  is taken as a convex or concave function of the gap or loop
                  length. The time complexity of our algorithms depends almost
                  linearly on the number of points that need to be considered;
                  when the problems are sparse, this results in a substantial

                  set of local maps that are guaranteed to be statistically
                  independent. The upper (or global) level is an adjacency graph
                  whose arcs are labeled with the relative location between
                  local maps. An estimation of these relative locations is
                  maintained at this level in a relative stochastic map. We

                  consistency at the global level at a computational cost that

  abstract =     {Recently, there have been a number of variant Simultaneous
                  Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms which have made
                  substantial progress towards large-area scalability by
                  parameterizing the SLAM posterior within the information
                  (canonical/inverse covariance) form. Of these, probably the
                  most well-known and popular approach is the Sparse Extended
                  Information Filter (SEIF) by Thrun et al. While SEIFs have
                  been successfully implemented with a variety of challenging
                  real-world data sets and have lead to new insights into
                  scalable SLAM, open research questions remain regarding the
                  approximate sparsification procedure and its effect on map
                  error and consistency. In this paper, we examine the
                  constant-time SEIF sparsification procedure in depth and offer
                  new insight into issues of consistency. In particular, we show
                  that exaggerated map inconsistency occurs within the global
                  reference frame where estimation is performed, but that
                  empirical testing shows that relative local map relationships
                  are preserved. We then present a slightly modified version of
                  their sparsification procedure which is shown to preserve
                  sparsity while also generating both local and global map
                  estimates comparable to those obtained by the non-sparsified
                  SLAM filter; this modified approximation, however, is no
                  longer constant-time. We demonstrate our findings by benchmark
                  comparison of the modified and original SEIF sparsification
                  rule using simulation in the linear Gaussian SLAM case and
                  real-world experiments for a nonlinear dataset.},

                  low-overlap imagery constraints typical of underwater vehicles
                  while exploiting the inertial sensor information that is
                  routinely available on such platforms.We present a novel
                  strategy for efciently accessing and maintaining consistent
                  covariance bounds within a SLAM information lter, thereby
                  greatly increasing the reliability of data association. The
                  technique is based upon solving a sparse system of linear
                  equations coupled with the application of constant-time Kalman
                  updates. The method is shown to produce consistent covariance
                  estimates suitable for robot planning and data association.
                  Real-world results are presented for a vision-based 6-DOF SLAM

  abstract =     {This paper addresses the problem of segmenting an image into
                  regions. We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for
                  a boundary between two regions using a graph-based
                  representation of the image. We then develop an efficient
                  segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that
                  although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces
                  segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the
                  algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of
                  local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate
                  the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm
                  runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is
                  also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the
                  method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability
                  image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability
                  regions.},

  abstract =     {Autonomous vehicles require the ability to build maps of an
                  unknown environment while concurrently using these maps for
                  navigation. Current algorithms for this concurrent mapping and
                  localization (CML) problem have been implemented for single
                  vehicles, but do not account for extra positional information
                  available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously.
                  Multiple vehicles have the potential to map an environment
                  more quickly and robustly than a single vehicle. This paper
                  presents a cooperative CML algorithm that merges sensor and
                  navigation information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The
                  algorithm presented is based on stochastic estimation and uses
                  a feature-based approach to extract landmarks from the
                  environment. The theoretical framework for the collaborative
                  CML algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem central
                  to the cooperative CML problem is proved for the first time.
                  This theorem quanti£es the performance gains of collaboration,
                  allowing for determination of the number of cooperating
                  vehicles required to accomplish a task. A simulated
                  implementation of the collaborative CML algorithm demonstrates
                  substantial performance improvement over non-cooperative CML.},

                  processes of seeing - vision is after all the main way in
                  which we gather information about the world. But human vision
                  is a dynamic process during which the eyes continually sample
                  the environment. Where most books on vision consider it as a
                  passive activity, this book is unique in focusing on vision as
                  an 'active' process. It goes beyond most accounts of vision
                  where the focus is on seeing, to provide an integrated account
                  of seeing AND looking. The book starts by pointing out the
                  weaknesses in our traditional approaches to vision and the
                  reason we need this new approach. It then gives a thorough
                  description of basic details of the visual and oculomotor
                  systems necessary to understand active vision. The book goes
                  on to show how this approach can give a new perspective on
                  visual attention, and how the approach has progressed in the
                  areas of visual orienting, reading, visual search, scene
                  perception and neuropsychology. Finally, the book summarises
                  progress by showing how this approach sheds new light on the
                  old problem of how we maintain perception of a stable visual
                  world. Written by two leading vision scientists, this book
                  will be valuable for vision researchers and psychology
                  students, from undergraduate level upwards.}

                  localization and mapping, SLAM. This approach has the highly
                  desirable property of robustness to data association errors.
                  Another important advantage of our algorithm is that
                  non-linearities are computed exactly, so that global
                  constraints can be imposed even if they result in large shifts
                  to the map. We represent the map as a graph and use the graph
                  to find an efficient map update algorithm. We also show how
                  topological consistency can be imposed on the map, such as,
                  closing a loop. The algorithm has been implemented on an
                  outdoor robot and we have experimental validation of our
                  ideas. We also explain how the graph can be simplified leading
                  to linear approximations of sections of the map. This
                  reduction gives us a natural way to connect local map patches
                  into a much larger global map.},

                  localization and mapping, SLAM, with a feature representation
                  that addresses symmetries and constraints in the feature
                  coordinates, the measurement subspace, M-space. The graphical
                  method has the advantages of delayed linearizations and soft
                  commitment to feature measurement matching. It also allows
                  large maps to be built up as a network of small local patches,
                  star nodes. This local map net is then easier to work with.
                  The formation of the star nodes is explicitly stable and
                  invariant with all the symmetries of the original
                  measurements. All linearization errors are kept small by using
                  a local frame. The construction of this invariant star is made
                  clearer by the Mspace feature representation. The M-space
                  allows the symmetries and constraints of the measurements to
                  be explicitly represented. We present results using both

  abstract =     {In this paper we describe an approach to feature
                  representation for simultaneous localization and mapping,
                  SLAM. It is a general representation for features that
                  addresses symmetries and constraints in the feature
                  coordinates. Furthermore, the representation allows for the
                  features to be added to the map with partial initialization.
                  This is an important property when using oriented vision
                  features where angle information can be used before their full
                  pose is known. The number of the dimensions for a feature can
                  grow with time as more information is acquired. At the same
                  time as the special properties of each type of feature are
                  accounted for, the commonalities of all map features are also
                  exploited to allow SLAM algorithms to be interchanged as well
                  as choice of sensors and features. In other words the SLAM
                  implementation need not be changed at all when changing
                  sensors and features and vice versa. Experimental results both
                  with vision and range data and combinations thereof are

                  problem in mobile robotics. In this paper we present an
                  approach to distributed multi-robot mapping and exploration.
                  Our system enables teams of robots to efciently explore
                  environments from different, unknown locations. In order to
                  ensure consistency when combining their data into shared maps,
                  the robots actively seek to verify their relative locations.
                  Using shared maps, they coordinate their exploration
                  strategies so as to maximize the efciency of exploration. Our
                  system was evaluated under extremely realistic real-world
                  conditions. An outside evaluation team found the system to be
                  highly efcient and robust. The maps generated by our approach
                  are consistently more accurate than those generated by
                  manually measuring the locations and extensions of rooms and
                  objects.},

                  that explicitly implement biological navigation behaviours. We
                  review these biomimetic approaches using a framework that
                  allows for a common description of biological and technical
                  navigation behaviour. The review shows that biomimetic systems
                  make significant contributions to two fields of research:
                  First, they provide a real world test of models of biological
                  navigation behaviour; second, they make new navigation
                  mechanisms available for technical applications, most notably
                  in the field of indoor robot navigation. While simpler insect
                  navigation behaviours have been implemented quite
                  successfully, the more complicated way-finding capabilities of
                  vertebrates still pose a challenge to current systems.},

                  and mapping (SLAM) by a mobile robot. An incremental SLAM
                  algorithm is introduced that is derived from socalled
                  multigrid methods used for solving partial differential
                  equations. The approach overcomes the relatively slow
                  convergence of previous relaxation methods because it
                  optimizes the map at multiple levels of resolution. The
                  resulting algorithm has an update time that is linear in the
                  number of mapped features, even when closing very large loops,
                  and offers advantages in handling non-linearities compared to
                  previous approaches. Experimental comparisons with alternative
                  algorithms using two well-known data sets are also presented.},

                  approach},
  abstract =     {“Background subtraction” is an old technique for finding
                  moving objects in a video sequence—for example, cars driving
                  on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image
                  from a time-averaged background image will leave only
                  nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation
                  to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it
                  fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish
                  shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is
                  that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that
                  pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a
                  mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using
                  an unsupervised technique—an efficient, incremental version of
                  EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this
                  automatically updates the mixture component for each class
                  according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving
                  objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies
                  and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other
                  techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as
                  part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected
                  to result in significant improvements in vehicle
                  identification and tracking.},

                  level interpretation and localization in complex scenes. In
                  urban environments, recognition of buildings might play a
                  dominant role in robotic systems that need object based
                  navigation, that take advantage of visual feedback and
                  multimodal information for self-localization, or that enable
                  association to related information from the identified
                  semantics. We present a new method "the informative local
                  features approach" based on an information theoretic saliency
                  measure that is rapidly derived from a local Parzen window
                  density estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of a
                  decision tree based mapping to informative features, it
                  enables attentive access to discriminative information and
                  thereby significantly speeds up the recognition process. This
                  approach is highly robust with respect to severe degrees of
                  partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some changes in
                  scale and illumination. We present performance evaluation on
                  our publicly available reference object database (TSG-20) that
                  demonstrates the efficiency of this approach, case wise even
                  outperforming the SIFT feature approach. Building recognition
                  will be advantageous in various application domains, such as,
                  mobile mapping, unmanned vehicle navigation, and systems for

  abstract =     {According to present genetic theory, the fine structure of
                  genes consists of linearly ordered elements. A mutant gene is
                  obtained by alteration of some connected portion of this
                  structure. By examining data obtained from suitable
                  experiments, it can be determined whether or not the blemished
                  portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and thus
                  intersection data for a large number of mutants can be
                  represented as an undirected graph. If this graph is an
                  "interval graph", then the observed data are consistent with a
                  linear model of the gene. Given a family of sets
                  S\_1,S\_2,{\textbackslash}cdots,S\_n, one can form the
                  intersection graph of the family by associating a vertex of
                  the graph with each set and joining two distinct vertices with
                  an edge if their corresponding sets have a nonempty
                  intersection. Conversely, any finite graph can, of course, be
                  viewed as the intersection graph of a family of sets (in many
                  ways). If each set can be taken as an interval on the real
                  line, the graph is called an interval graph. The problem of
                  determining when a graph is an interval graph is a special
                  case of the following problem concerning (0,1)-matrices: When
                  can the rows of such a matrix be permuted so as to make the
                  1's in each column appear consecutively? A complete theory is
                  obtained for this latter problem, culminating in a
                  decomposition theorem which leads to a rapid algorithm for
                  deciding the question, and for constructing the desired
                  permutation when one exists.},

                  surveillance systems and is used to quickly identify regions
                  of interest. To increase the robustness of background
                  subtraction techniques, researchers have developed techniques
                  to update the background model and also developed
                  probabilistic/statistical approaches for thresholding the
                  difference. This paper presents an error analysis of this type
                  of background modeling and pixel labeling, providing both
                  theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Evaluation
                  is cen- tered around the tradeoff of probability of false
                  alarm and probability of miss detection, and this paper shows
                  how to efficiently compute these probabilities from simpler
                  values that are more easily measured. It includes an analysis
                  for both static and dynamic background modeling. The paper
                  also examines the assumptions of Gaussian and mixture of
                  Gaussian models for a pixel.},

  abstract =     {For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the world
                  around them, they will likely require a deeper understanding
                  of the world in which they operate. In robotics and related
                  research fields, the study of understanding is often referred
                  to as semantics, which dictateswhat does the world “mean” to a
                  robot, and is strongly tied to the question ofhow to represent
                  that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in
                  the same world, the prospects of human–robot interaction also
                  bringsemantics and ontology of natural language into the
                  picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like
                  increasing availability of training data and computational
                  resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in
                  robotics. The field has received significant attention in the
                  research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have
                  focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical
                  research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics
                  like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one
                  particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new
                  treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so
                  much relevant research has occurred since many of the key
                  surveys were published. This survey therefore provides an
                  overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands
                  today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or
                  relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of
                  activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both.
                  Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics
                  including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key
                  robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including
                  mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey
                  also covers key practical considerations, including enablers
                  like increased data availability and improved computational
                  hardware, and major application areas where semantics is or is
                  likely to play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to
                  provide researchers across academia and industry with a
                  comprehensive reference that helps facilitate future research
                  in this exciting field.},

  volume =       16,
  abstract =     {This paper proposes a method for the visual-based navigation
                  of a mobile robot in indoor environments, using a single
                  omni-directional (catadioptric) camera. The geometry of the
                  catadioptric sensor and the method used to obtain a bird? eye
                  (orthographic) view of the ground plane are presented. This
                  representation significantly simplifies the solution to
                  navigation problems, by eliminating any perspective effects.
                  The nature of each navigation taskis taken into account when
                  designing the required navigation skills and environmental
                  representations. We propose two main navigation modalities:
                  Topological Navigation and Visual Path Following. Topological
                  Navigation is used for traveling long distances and does not
                  require knowledge of the exact position of the robot but
                  rather, a qualitative position on the topological map. The
                  navigation process combines appearance based methods and
                  visual servoing upon some environmental features. Visual Path
                  Following is required for local, very precise navigation, for
                  e.g. door traversal, docking. The robot is controlled to
                  follow a pre-specified path accurately, by tracking visual
                  landmarks in bird? eye views of the ground plane. By clearly
                  separating the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and
                  yet powerful navigation system is obtained.},

                  degree algorithm has received much study, and many important
                  enhancements have been made to it. This paper describes these
                  various enhancements, their historical development, and some
                  experiments showing how very effective they are in improving
                  the execution time of the algorithm. A shortcoming is also
                  presented that exists in all of the widely used
                  implementations of the algorithm, namely, that the quality of
                  the ordering provided by the implementations is surprisingly
                  sensitive to the initial ordering. For example, changing the
                  input ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as
                  much as a factor of three in the cost of the subsequent
                  numerical factorization. This sensitivity is caused by the
                  lack of an effective tie-breaking strategy, and the authors'
                  experiments illustrate the importance of developing such a

                  physical objects is presented. Since the controlling
                  stimulation for such behaviour is mainly optical, this
                  involves novel assumptions about object perception and about
                  what is called 'visual kinaesthesis'. Evidence for these
                  assumptions is cited. On the basis of this theory it is
                  possible to suppose that animals are visually oriented to the
                  surfaces of their environment, not merely to light as such. In

                  wide baseline image matching is described. The targeted
                  application is visual navigation, e.g. of a semi-automatic
                  wheelchair. Such applications pose some additional
                  requirements, like the need to work with natural landmarks
                  rather than artificial markers, and the need to recognize
                  locations fast. The restricted motion of the camera can be
                  exploited to simplify the feature extraction. These features
                  should support their identification from different, but
                  nevertheless restricted viewing directions, and under variable
                  illumination conditions. The paper proposes a specialization
                  of so-called affine invariant regions for these particular
                  conditions, which in this case simplifies to column segments.
                  Their applicability is wider than robot navigation, and

                  they are a rich source of environment information. The main
                  challenge in using images for mobile robots is managing this
                  wealth of information. A relatively recent approach is the use
                  of fast wide baseline local features, which we developed and
                  used in the novel approach to sparse visual path following
                  described in this paper. These local features have the great
                  advantage that they can be recognized even if the viewpoint
                  differs significantly. This opens the door to a memory
                  efficient description of a path by descriptors of sparse
                  images. We propose a method for re-execution of these paths by

                  into tree schemas and cyclic schemas. (These are called
                  acyclic hypergraphs and cyclic hypergraphs elsewhere in the
                  literature.) This partition has interesting implications in
                  query processing, dependency theory, and graph theory. The
                  tree/cyclic partitioning of database schemas originated with a
                  similar partition of equijoin queries. Given an arbitrary
                  equijoin query one can obtain an equivalent query that
                  calculates the natural join of all relations in (an
                  efficiently) derived database; such a query is called a
                  natural join (NJ) query. If the derived database is a tree
                  schema the original query is said to be a tree query, and
                  otherwise a cyclic query. In this paper we analyze query
                  processing consequences of the tree/cyclic partitioning. We
                  are able to argue, qualitatively, that queries which imply a
                  tree schema are easier to process than those implying a cyclic
                  schema. Our results also extend the study of the semijoin

                  problems (CSPs). We first give a uniform presentation of the
                  major structural CSP decomposition methods. We then introduce
                  a new class of tractable CSPs based on the concept of
                  hypertree decomposition recently developed in Database Theory,
                  and analyze the cost of solving CSPs having bounded
                  hypertree-width. We provide a framework for comparing
                  parametric decomposition-based methods according to
                  tractability criteria and compare the most relevant methods.
                  We show that the method of hypertree decomposition dominates
                  the others in the case of general CSPs (i.e., CSPs of
                  unbounded arity). We also make comparisons for the restricted
                  case of binary CSPs. Finally, we consider the application of
                  decomposition methods to the dual graph of a hypergraph. In
                  fact, this technique is often used to exploit binary
                  decomposition methods for nonbinary CSPs. However, even in
                  this case, the hypertree-decomposition method turns out to be
                  the most general method.},

                  decentralized sensor networks in which there is no central
                  fusion center and in which no single sensor node has global
                  knowledge of network topology. An algorlthm is described which
                  is able to locally process and assimilate data in such
                  networks and which yields an identical result to that obtained
                  in a centralized system. An implementation of this
                  decentralized data fusion algorithm on a process control rig
                  incorporating over 150 sensors and 30 processors is described.
                  The results show that the decentralized data fusion system

  abstract =     {Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) have been
                  introduced as an effective means to solve the simultaneous
                  localization and mapping problem. This approach uses a
                  particle filter in which each particle carries an individual
                  map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to
                  reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present
                  adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for
                  learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an
                  accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only
                  the movement of the robot, but also the most recent
                  observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about
                  the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter.
                  Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out
                  resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of
                  particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real
                  mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor,
                  environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over
                  previous approaches},

                  particle filters by adaptive proposals and selective
                  resampling},
  abstract =     {Recently Rao-Blackwellized particle lters have been introduced
                  as effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) problem. This approach uses a particle lter in
                  which each particle carries an individual map of the
                  environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the
                  number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive
                  techniques to reduce the number of particles in a
                  Rao-Blackwellized particle lter for learning grid maps. We
                  propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal
                  distribution taking into account not only the movement of the
                  robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically
                  decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the
                  prediction step of the lter. Furthermore, we present an
                  approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which
                  seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion.
                  Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in
                  large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments
                  illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous
                  approaches.},

                  {Efficient} {Map} {Learning}},
  abstract =     {Learning models of the environment is one of the fundamental
                  tasks of mobile robots since maps are needed for a wide range
                  of robotic applications, such as navigation and transportation
                  tasks, service robotic applications, and several others. In
                  the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have
                  been proposed. Most of them, however, assume that the robot
                  lives on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efficient
                  maximum likelihood approach that is able to solve 3D as well
                  as 2D problems. Our approach addresses the so-called
                  graph-based formulation of the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as an extension of Olson's
                  algorithm towards non-flat environments. It applies a novel
                  parameterization of the nodes of the graph that significantly
                  improves the performance of the algorithm and can cope with
                  arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to bound
                  the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped area
                  and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our
                  approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch
                  and yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3D mapping problems.
                  We implemented our technique and compared it to multiple other
                  graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated and
                  in real world experiments, our method converges faster than
                  the other approaches and yields accurate maps of the
                  environment.},

  abstract =     {In 2006, Olson et al. presented a novel approach to address
                  the graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping problem

                  introduced by constraints. Together with multi-level
                  relaxation, this is one of the most robust and efficient

                  approach which utilizes the Monte Carlo Lo- calization (MCL)
                  [2], a Bayesian filtering technique based on a density
                  representation by means of par- ticles. The capability of this
                  method to approximate arbitrary likelihood densities is a
                  crucial property for dealing with highly ambiguous
                  localization hypotheses as are typical for real-world
                  environments. We show how omidirectional imaging can be
                  combined with the MCL-algorithm to globally localize and track
                  a mobile robot given a taught graph-based representation of
                  the operation area. In contrast to other approaches, the nodes

                  Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) algorithm.
                  It presents optimal algorithms that consider the special form
                  of the matrices and a new compressed filter that can
                  significantly reduce the computation requirements when working
                  in local areas or with high frequency external sensors. It is
                  shown that by extending the standard Kalman filter models the
                  information gained in a local area can be maintained with a
                  cost O(Na{\textasciicircum}2), where Na is the number of
                  landmarks in the local area, and then transferred to the
                  overall map in only one iteration at full SLAM computational
                  cost. Additional simplifications are also presented that are
                  very close to optimal when an appropriate map representation
                  is used. Finally the algorithms are validated with
                  experimental results obtained with a standard vehicle running
                  in a completely unstructured outdoor environment.},

                  labeled data requires determining correspondence between image
                  regions and semantic object classes. Most approaches use
                  co-occurrence of nouns� and image features over large datasets
                  to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence
                  ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence
                  problem by exploiting additional language constructs to
                  improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We
                  consider both �prepositions� and comparative adjectives� which
                  are used to express relationships between objects. If the
                  models of such relationships can be determined, they help
                  resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models
                  of these relationships requires solving the correspondence
                  problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining
                  �nouns� and the differential visual features defining such
                  binary-relationships� using an EM-based approach.},

                  algorithm for the purpose of background model initialization.
                  The algorithm takes as input a video sequence in which moving
                  objects are present, and outputs a statistical background
                  model describing the static parts of the scene. Multiple
                  hypotheses of the background value at each pixel are generated
                  by locating periods o stable f intensity in the sequence. The
                  likelihood of each hypothesis is then evaluated using optical
                  flow information from the neighborhood around the pixel, and
                  the most likely hypothesis is chosen to represent the
                  background. Our results are compared with those of several

                  cooccurrence matrices is described. An analysis of the
                  distributions within a cooccurrence matrix defines an initial
                  pixel classification into both region and interior or boundary
                  designations. Local consistency of pixel classification is
                  then implemented by minimizing the entropy of local
                  information, where region information is expressed via
                  conditional probabilities estimated from the cooccurrence
                  matrices, and boundary information via conditional
                  probabilities which are determined a priori. The method
                  robustly segments an image into homogeneous areas and
                  generates an edge map. The technique extends easily to general
                  edge operators. An example is given for the Canny operator.

                  directionally oriented, topographically organised neural map

                  which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides
                  with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral trriangles
                  spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring
                  cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their certex
                  locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of
                  individual fields increase from dorsal to central dMEC. The

                  distinct analyses for determining their direction of motion,
                  or heading: a scene-based analysis and a motion-based
                  analysis. In two experiments, subjects viewed sequentially
                  presented, paired digitized images of real-world scenes and
                  judged the direction of heading; the pairs were presented with
                  various interstimulus intervals (ISIs). In Experiment 1,
                  subjects could determine heading when the two frames were
                  separated with a 1,000-ms ISI, long enough to eliminate
                  apparent motion. In Experiment 2, subjects performed two
                  tasks, a path-of-motion task and a memory-load task, under
                  three different ISIs, 50 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms. Heading
                  accuracy decreased with an increase in ISI. Increasing memory
                  load influenced heading judgments only for the longer ISI when
                  motion-based information was not available. These results are

                  a prerequisite for autonomous mobile robots. A particularly
                  challenging problem in acquiring environment maps is that of
                  closing loops; loops in the environment create challenging
                  data association problems [9]. This paper presents a novel
                  algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering
                  and scan matching. In our approach scan matching is used for
                  minimizing odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic
                  model of the residual errors of scan matching process is then
                  used for the resampling steps. This way the number of samples
                  required is seriously reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the
                  particle depletion problem that typically prevents the robot
                  from closing large loops. We present extensive experiments
                  that illustrate the superior performance of our approach

                  Dynamic objects, however, can lead to serious errors in the
                  resulting maps such as spurious objects or misalignments due
                  to localization errors. In this paper we consider the problem
                  of creating maps with mobile robots in dynamic environments.
                  We present a new approach that interleaves mapping and
                  localization with a probabilistic technique to identify
                  spurious measurements. In several experiments we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm generates accurate 2d and 3d in different
                  kinds of dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. We also use
                  our algorithm to isolate the dynamic objects and to generate
                  three-dimensional representation of them.},

  abstract =     {Density-based modeling of visual features is very common in
                  computer vision, either by using non-parametric techniques or
                  through representing the underlying density function as a
                  weighted sum of Gaussians. A number of real-time tasks such as
                  background modeling or modeling the appearance of a moving
                  target require sequential density estimation, where new data
                  is incorporated in the model as it becomes available.
                  Nevertheless, current methods for updating the density
                  function either lack flexibility, by fixing the number of
                  Gaussians in the mixture, or require large memory amounts, by
                  maintaining a non-parametric representation of the den- sity.
                  This paper presents an efficient method for recursive density
                  approximation that relies on the propagation of the density
                  modes. At each time step, the modes of the density are
                  re-estimated and a Gaussian component is assigned to each
                  mode. The covariance of each component is derived from the
                  Hessian matrix estimated at the mode location. To detect the
                  modes we employ the variable-bandwidth mean shift. While the
                  proposed density representation is memory efficient (which is
                  typical for mixture densities), it inherits the flexibility of
                  non-parametric methods, by allowing the number of modes to
                  adapt in time. We show that the same mode propagation
                  principle applies for subspaces derived from eigen analysis.
                  Extensive experimental background modeling results demonstrate
                  the performance of the method.},

                  tasks that are amenable to multiprocessor implementation are
                  described. The natural origins of such multitasking are
                  emphasized, and novel parallel structures for state estimation
                  using the Kalman filter are proposed that extend existing
                  results in several directions. In particular, hierarchical
                  network structures are developed that have the property that
                  the optimal global estimate based on all the available
                  information can be reconstructed from estimates computed by
                  local processor nodes solely on the basis of their own local
                  information and transmitted to a central processor. The
                  algorithms potentially yield an approximately linear speedup

                  that saccadic eye movements reflect cognitive processes. But
                  it is only recently that three separate advances have greatly
                  expanded our understanding of the intricate role of eye
                  movements in cognitive function. The first is the
                  demonstration of the pervasive role of the task in guiding
                  where and when to fixate. The second has been the recognition
                  of the role of internal reward in guiding eye and body
                  movements, revealed especially in neurophysiological studies.
                  The third important advance has been the theoretical
                  developments in the fields of reinforcement learning and
                  graphic simulation. All of these advances are proving crucial
                  for understanding how behavioral programs control the
                  selection of visual information.},

  title =        {Vision using routines: a functional account of vision},
  volume =       7,
  abstract =     {This paper presents the case for a functional account of
                  vision. A variety of studies have consistently revealed ?hange
                  blindness?or insensitivity to changes in the visual scene
                  during an eye movement. These studies indicate that only a
                  small part of the information in the scene is represented in
                  the brain from moment to moment. It is still unclear, however,
                  exactly what is included in visual representations. This paper
                  reviews experiments using an extended visuo-motor task,
                  showing that display changes affect performance differently
                  depending on the observer? place in the task. These effects
                  are revealed by increases in fixation duration following a
                  change. Different task-dependent increases suggest that the
                  visual system represents only the information that is
                  necessary for the immediate visual task. This allows a
                  principled exploration of the stimulus properties that are
                  included in the internal visual representation. The task
                  specificity also has a more general implication that vision
                  should be conceptualized as an active process executing
                  special purpose ?outines?that compute only the currently
                  necessary information. Evidence for this view and its
                  implications for visual representations are discussed.
                  Comparison of the change blindness phenomenon and fixation
                  durations shows that conscious report does not reveal the
                  extent of the representations computed by the routines.},

  abstract =     {A new model for dynamic programming and branch and bound
                  algorithms is presented. The model views these algorithms as
                  utilizing computationally feasible dominance relations to
                  infer the orderings of application objects, thereby implicitly
                  enumerating a finite solution space. The formalism is broad
                  enough to apply the computational strategies of dynamic
                  programming and branch and bound to problems with
                  nonassociative objects, and can model both oblivious and
                  nonoblivious algorithms, as well as parallel algorithms. The
                  model is used to classify computations based, in part, on the
                  types of computationally feasible dominances that they employ.
                  It is demonstrated that the model is computationally precise
                  enough to support the derivation of lower bounds on the number
                  of operations required to solve various types of problems.},

                  still pose considerable challenges in the application of range
                  sensors in the context of robotic navigation, especially in
                  the implementation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
                  (SLAM) with sparse features. This paper presents a combination
                  of methods in solving the SLAM problem in a constricted indoor
                  environment using small baseline stereo vision. Main
                  contributions include a feature selection and tracking
                  algorithm, a stereo noise filter, a robust feature validation
                  algorithm and a multiple hypotheses adaptive window
                  positioning method in "closing the loop". These methods take a
                  novel approach in that information from the image processing
                  and robotic navigation domains are used in tandem to augment
                  each other. Experimental results including a real-time

                  Furthermore, robust statistical techniques are normally used
                  to handle large number of outliers in correspondences. This
                  paper proposes a new method that avoids both. Motion is
                  calculated between two consecutive stereo images without any
                  pre-knowledge or prediction about feature location or the
                  possibly large camera movement. This permits a lower frame
                  rate and almost arbitrary movements. Euclidean constraints are
                  used to incrementally select inliers from a set of initial
                  correspondences, instead of using robust statistics that has
                  to handle all inliers and outliers together. These constraints
                  are so strong that the set of initial correspondences can
                  contain several times more outliers than inliers. Experiments
                  on a worst-case stereo sequence show that the method is
                  robust, accurate and can be used in real-time.},

  abstract =     {The recognition of objects in three-dimensional space is a
                  desirable capability of a computer vision system. Range
                  images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a
                  scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report
                  a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave
                  surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages.
                  The first stage segments the range image into “surface
                  patches” by a square error criterion clustering algorithm
                  using surface points and associated surface normals. The
                  second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or
                  concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend,
                  curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage,
                  boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as
                  crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to
                  merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the
                  object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a
                  large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we

  abstract =     {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using
                  pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points
                  in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds
                  applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I
                  present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares
                  problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical,
                  graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use.
                  Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit
                  quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry
                  property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The
                  best translational offset is the difference between the
                  centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and
                  scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The
                  best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square
                  deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their
                  respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred
                  to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected
                  points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is
                  the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue
                  of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are
                  combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates
                  of the points.},

                  categories, or other forms of prior knowledge of the objects.
                  By analyz- ing the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract
                  the spec- tral residual of an image in spectral domain, and
                  propose a fast method to construct the corresponding saliency

                  a mobile robot team into an unknown environment. The algorithm

                  information gathered by the previous robots to determine the

                  to maximize the area covered by the robots's sensors, while
                  simultaneously ensuring that the robots maintain line-of-sight

  abstract =     {This paper describes a novel representation for
                  two-dimensional maps, and shows how this representation may be
                  applied to the problem of multirobot simultaneous localization
                  and mapping. We are inspired by the notion of a manifold,
                  which takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto a
                  surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The key
                  advantage of the manifold representation is selfconsistency:
                  when closing loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the
                  "cross over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This
                  self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of important
                  capabilities, including autonomous exploration, search, and
                  retro-traverse. It also supports a very robust form of loop
                  closure, in which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm
                  or reject possible correspondence points. In this paper, we
                  develop the basic formalism of the manifold representation,
                  show how this may be applied to the multirobot simultaneous
                  localization and mapping problem, and present experimental
                  results obtained from teams of up to four robots in

  title =        {Relaxation on a mesh: a formalism for generalized
                  localization},
  abstract =     {This paper considers two problems which at first sight appear
                  to be quite distinct: localizing a robot in an unknown
                  environment and calibrating an embedded sensor network. We
                  show that both of these can be formulated as special cases of
                  a generalized localization problem. In the standard
                  localization problem, the aim is to determine the pose of some
                  object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global
                  coordinate system. In our generalized version, the aim is to
                  determine the pose of all elements in a network (both fixed
                  and mobile) relative to an arbitrary global coordinate system.
                  We have developed a physically inspired "meshbased" formalism
                  for solving such problems. This paper outlines the formalism,
                  and describes its application to the concrete tasks of
                  multi-robot mapping and calibration of a distributed sensor
                  network. The paper presents experimental results for both
                  tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer mobile robots equipped

                  core challenge for this program is to develop a system capable
                  of carrying out 'locate-and-protect' missions: the system must
                  be able to deploy a large number of robots into an unexplored
                  building, map the building interior, locate a valued object,
                  detect and track intruders, and transmit all of the above
                  information to a remote observer/operator. To satisfy these
                  requirements, we have developed a large heterogeneous robot
                  team consisting of approximately 80 robots. This paper

                  algorithm achieves exact recovery instead of approximate
                  recovery. The recovery algorithm is very efficient because of
                  an incremental Cholesky factorization approach and a natural
                  reordering of the global state vector. Simulation results show
                  that the computation cost of the SLSJF is much lower as
                  compared with the sequential map joining algorithm using
                  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The SLSJF with the proposed

  abstract =     {To interact effectively with humans, mobile robots will need
                  certain skills. One particularly important skill is the
                  ability to pursue moving agents. To do this, the robot needs a
                  robust visual tracking algorithm and an effective obstacle
                  avoidance algorithm, plus a means of integrating these two
                  behaviors in a seamless manner. In this paper, we introduce
                  the proximity space method as a means for performing
                  real-time, behavior-based control of visual gaze. We then show
                  how this method is integrated with robot motion using an
                  intelligent control architecture that can automatically
                  reconfigure the robot's behaviors in response to environmental
                  changes. The resulting implementation pursues people and other

  volume =       23,
  abstract =     {Most recent robotic systems, capable of exploring unknown
                  environments, use topological structures (graphs) as a spatial
                  representation. Localization can be done by deriving an
                  estimate of the global pose from landmark information. In this
                  case navigation is tightly coupled to metric knowledge, and
                  hence the derived control method is mainly pose-based.
                  Alternative to continuous metric localization, it is also
                  possible to base localization methods on weaker constraints,
                  e.g. the similarity between images capturing the appearance of
                  places or landmarks. In this case navigation can be controlled
                  by a homing algorithm. Similarity based localization can be
                  scaled to continuous metric localization by adding additional
                  constraints, such as alignment of depth estimates. We present
                  a method to scale a similarity based navigation system (the
                  view-graph-model) to continuous metric localization. Instead
                  of changing the landmark model, we embed the graph into the
                  three dimensional pose space. Therefore, recalibration of the
                  path integrator is only possible at discrete locations in the
                  environment. The navigation behavior of the robot is
                  controlled by a homing algorithm which combines three local
                  navigation capabilities, obstacle avoidance, path integration,
                  and scene based homing. This homing scheme allows automated
                  adaptation to the environment. It is further used to
                  compensate for path integration errors, and therefore allows
                  to derive globally consistent pose estimates based on
                  ?eak?metric knowledge, i.e. knowledge solely derived from
                  odometry. The system performance is tested with a robotic
                  setup and with a simulated agent which explores a large, open,

                  constructs 3D models from a collection of panoramic image
                  mosaics. A panoramic mosaic consists of a set of images taken
                  around the same viewpoint, and a transformation matrix
                  associated with each input image. Our system first recovers
                  the camera pose for each mosaic from known line directions and
                  points, and then constructs the 3D model using all available
                  geometrical constraints. We partition constraints into soft
                  and hard linear constraints so that the modeling process can
                  be formulated as a linearlyconstrained least-squares problem,
                  which can be solved efficiently using QR factorization. The
                  results of extracting wire frame and texture-mapped 3D models

  abstract =     {Automatic self-calibration of ad-hoc sensor networks is a
                  critical need for their use in military or civilian
                  applications. In general, self-calibration involves the
                  combination of absolute location information (e.g. GPS) with
                  relative calibration information (e.g. time delay or received
                  signal strength between sensors) over regions of the network.
                  Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the
                  computational burden across the network and minimize the
                  amount of inter-sensor communication. We demonstrate that the
                  information used for sensor calibration is fundamentally local
                  with regard to the network topology and use this observation
                  to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework.
                  We then demonstrate the utility of nonparametric belief
                  propagation (NBP), a recent generalization of particle
                  filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and
                  representing location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage
                  that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion, admits
                  a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent
                  multi-modal uncertainty. We illustrate the performance of NBP
                  on several example networks while comparing to a previously
                  published nonlinear least squares method.},

                  small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and

                  distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper,
                  we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such
                  coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric in that all
                  communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed
                  diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables
                  diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically
                  good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We
                  explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a
                  simple remote-surveillance sensor network.},

                  comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing different
                  numbers of objects. Second, a Bayesian multi-object filter
                  which uses the abovementioned multi-blob likelihood function
                  as the observation model. Using the standard machinery of
                  particle filters, this results in a filter which is able to
                  track an unknown and varying number of objects. the paper is
                  very well written and easily understandable though the

                  article concludes with several practical examples for the
                  strengths of particle fitlering in the context of
                  probabilistic object tracking. Recommended as an entry point
                  for CONDENSATION/particle filter based object tracking.}

                  the samples in the resampling step not with respect to their
                  likelihoods but to a so-called importance function. The
                  application in the paper is hand tracking thus skin color is
                  the natural choice as this "guiding" cue for importance
                  sampling. This well-written paper provides an almost natural
                  extension to the original probabilistic tracking algorithm

                  for sensor-actuator networks that perform engineering tasks.
                  We provide a new foundation for data fusion based on two
                  concepts: a conceptual framework and the goal-seeking
                  paradigm. The conceptual framework emphasizes the dominant
                  structures in the system. The goal-seeking paradigm is a
                  mechanism for representing system evolution that explicitly
                  manages uncertainty. The goal-seeking formulation for data
                  fusion helps to distinguish between subjective decisions that
                  can be executed by computers. These notions are useful for
                  critical tasks, such as security management in large-scale
                  distributed systems. Investigations in this area, and further
                  refinement of the goal-seeking formulation for instrumentation
                  and measurement applications, are likely to future systems
                  that facilitate holistic user decision making.},

  abstract =     {We present a background subtraction method that uses multiple
                  cues to robustly detect objects in adverse conditions. The
                  algorithm consists of three distinct levels i.e pixel level,
                  region level and frame level. At the pixel level, statistical
                  models of gradients and color are separately used to classify
                  each pixel as belonging to background or foreground. In region
                  level, foreground pixels obtained from the color based
                  subtraction are grouped into regions and gradient based sub-
                  traction is then used to make inferences about the validity of
                  these regions. Pixel based models are updated based on
                  decisions made at the region level. Finally frame level
                  analysis is performed to detect global illumination changes.
                  Our method provides the solution to some of the common prob-
                  lems that are not addressed by most background subtraction
                  algorithms such as quick illumination changes, repositioning
                  of static background objects, and initialization of background
                  model with moving objects present in the scene.},

  volume =       23,
  abstract =     {This paper deals with the problem of recovering the dimensions
                  of an object and its pose from a single image acquired with a
                  camera of unknown focal length. It is assumed that the object
                  in question can be modeled as a polyhedron where the
                  coordinates of the vertices can be expressed as a linear
                  function of a dimension vector. The reconstruction program
                  takes as input, a set of correspondences between features in
                  the model and features in the image. From this information,
                  the program determines an appropriate projection model for the
                  camera, the dimensions of the object, its pose relative to the
                  camera and, in the case of perspective projection, the focal
                  length of the camera. This paper describes how the
                  reconstruction problem can be framed as an optimization over a
                  compact set with low dimension (no more than four). This
                  optimization problem can be solved efficiently by coupling
                  standard nonlinear optimization techniques with a multistart
                  method. The result is an efficient, reliable solution system
                  that does not require initial estimates for any of the
                  parameters being estimated},

  volume =       2,
  abstract =     {We present a system that consists of one camera connected to a
                  personal computer that can (a) select and track a number of
                  high-contrast point features on a sequence of images, (b)
                  estimate their three-dimensional motion and position relative
                  to an inertial reference frame, assuming rigidity, (c) handle
                  occlusions that cause point-features to disappear as well as
                  new features to appear. The system can also (d) perform
                  partial self-calibration and (e) check for consistency of the
                  rigidity assumption, although these features are not
                  implemented in the current release. All of this is done
                  automatically and in real-time (30 Hz) for 40-50 point
                  features using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. The system
                  is based on an algorithm presented by Chiuso et al. (2000),
                  the properties of which have been analyzed by Chiuso and
                  Soatto (2000). In particular, the algorithm is provably
                  observable, provably minimal and provably stable- under
                  suitable conditions. The core of the system, consisting of C++
                  code ready to interface with a frame grabber as well as Matlab
                  code for development, is available at
                  http://ee.wustl.edu/-soatto/research.html. We demonstrate the
                  system by showing its use as (1) an ego-motion estimator, (2)
                  an object tracker, and (3) an interactive input device, all
                  without any modification of the system settings},

  abstract =     {In general, multiple views are required to create a complete
                  3-D model of an object or of a multi-roomed indoor scene. In
                  this work, we address the problem of merging multiple textured
                  3-D data sets, each of which corresponds to a different view
                  of a scene or object. There are two steps to the merging
                  process: registration and integration. To register, or align,
                  data sets we use a modified version of the Iterative Closest
                  Point algorithm; our version, which we call color ICP,
                  considers not only 3-D information, but color as well. We show
                  that the use of color decreases registration error by an order
                  of magnitude. Once the 3-D data sets have been registered we
                  integrate them to produce a seamless, composite 3-D textured
                  model. Our approach to integration uses a 3-D occupancy grid
                  to represent likelihood of spatial occupancy through voting.
                  In addition to occupancy information, we store surface normal
                  in each voxel of the occupancy grid. Surface normal is used to
                  robustly extract a surface from the occupancy grid; on that
                  surface we blend textures from multiple views},

  volume =       30,
  abstract =     {We describe a model to estimate motion from monocular visual
                  and inertial measurements. We analyze the model and
                  characterize the conditions under which its state is
                  observable, and its parameters are identifiable. These include
                  the unknown gravity vector, and the unknown transformation
                  between the camera coordinate frame and the inertial unit. We
                  show that it is possible to estimate both state and parameters
                  as part of an on-line procedure, but only provided that the
                  motion sequence is `rich enough', a condition that we
                  characterize explicitly. We then describe an efficient
                  implementation of a filter to estimate the state and
                  parameters of this model, including gravity and
                  camera-to-inertial calibration. It runs in real-time on an
                  embedded platform. We report experiments of continuous
                  operation, without failures, re-initialization, or
                  re-calibration, on paths of length up to 30 km. We also
                  describe an integrated approach to loop-closure', that is the
                  recognition of previously seen locations and the topological
                  re-adjustment of the traveled path. It represents visual
                  features relative to the global orientation reference provided
                  by the gravity vector estimated by the filter, and relative to
                  the scale provided by their known position within the map;
                  these features are organized into `locations' defined by
                  visibility constraints, represented in a topological graph,
                  where loop-closure can be performed without the need to
                  re-compute past trajectories or perform bundle adjustment. The
                  software infrastructure as well as the embedded platform is
                  described in detail in a previous technical report.},

                  angular uncertainty, the full-covariance SLAM algorithm always
                  yields an inconsistent map. We also show, through simulations,

                  about the uncertainties of the estimation problem in the form
                  of marginal covariances. However, it is often difficult to
                  access these quantities without calculating the full and dense

                  smoothing, that is suitable for real-time applications in
                  large-scale environments. The main advantages over
                  filter-based algorithms are that we solve the full SLAM
                  problem without the need for any approximations, and that we
                  do not suffer from linearization errors. We achieve efficiency
                  by updating the square-root information matrix, a factored
                  version of the naturally sparse smoothing information matrix.
                  We can efficiently recover the exact trajectory and map at any
                  given time by back-substitution. Furthermore, our approach
                  allows access to the exact covariances, as it does not suffer
                  from under-estimation of uncertainties, which is another
                  problem inherent to filters. We present simulation-based
                  results for the linear case, showing constant time updates for
                  exploration tasks. We further evaluate the behavior in the
                  presence of loops, and discuss how our approach extends to the

                  sparse matrix factorization methods, afforded by the recently
                  introduced Bayes tree data structure. The original iSAM
                  algorithm incrementally maintains the square root information

  abstract =     {We present a novel data structure, the Bayes tree, that
                  provides an algorithmic foundation enabling a better
                  understanding of existing graphical model inference algorithms
                  and their connection to sparse matrix factorization methods.
                  Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored
                  probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed
                  and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix
                  of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem.
                  In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new
                  data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better
                  understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of
                  probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract
                  updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple
                  editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities.
                  Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel
                  algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named
                  iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through
                  incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization,
                  eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze
                  various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of
                  real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares
                  favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality
                  and efficiency.},

                  allows real-time application in large-scale environments. We
                  employ smoothing to obtain the complete trajectory and map
                  without the need for any approximations, exploiting the
                  natural sparsity of the smoothing information matrix. A
                  QR-factorization of this information matrix is at the heart of
                  our approach. It provides efficient access to the exact
                  covariances as well as to conservative estimates that are used
                  for online data association. It also allows recovery of the
                  exact trajectory and map at any given time by
                  back-substitution. Instead of refactoring in each step, we
                  update the QR-factorization whenever a new measurement
                  arrives. We analyze the effect of loops, and show how our
                  approach extends to the non-linear case. Finally, we provide

                  approach to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem
                  that is based on fast incremental matrix factorization. iSAM
                  provides an efficient and exact solution by updating a QR

                  with many loops as it avoids unnecessary fill-in in the factor
                  matrix by periodic variable reordering. Also, to enable data

  abstract =     {The problem of simultaneous localization and mapping has
                  received much attention over the last years. Especially large
                  scale environments, where the robot trajectory loops back on
                  itself, are a challenge. In this paper we introduce a new
                  solution to this problem of closing the loop. Our algorithm is
                  EM-based, but differs from previous work. The key is a
                  probability distribution over partitions of feature tracks
                  that is determined in the E-step, based on the current
                  estimate of the motion. This virtual structure is then used in
                  the M-step to obtain a better estimate for the motion. We
                  demonstrate the success of our algorithm in experiments on
                  real laser data.},

                  omni-directional sensors, the available resolution can be

                  odometry-based, and enables lowcost navigation in cluttered
                  and populated environments. No initial map is required, and it
                  satisfactorily handles dynamic changes in the environment, for
                  example, lighting changes, moving objects and/or people.
                  Typically, vSLAM recovers quickly from dramatic disturbances,
                  such as "kidnapping".},

                  reasoning areas such as join-tree clustering for
                  constraint-satisfaction and the clique-tree algorithm for
                  probabilistic reasoning. Within this framework, we introduce a
                  new algorithm, called bucket-tree elimination (BTE), that
                  extends Bucket Elimination (BE) to trees, and show that it can
                  provide a speed-up of n over BE for various reasoning tasks.

                  the key issues in robotics research. The multiple robot
                  systems require robust methods to identify robots for
                  collaborative behaviors. This paper proposes a method using
                  omnidirectional vision sensors for the identification between
                  the robots. In addition to the several advantages of the
                  omnidirectional vision sensor as a vision of a mobile robot,
                  the omnidirectional vision sensor brings a significant benefit
                  for realizing collaborative behaviors in multiple robot
                  systems. After discussing on the algorithm, this paper shows

                  In many interesting domains current planning algorithms fail

                  search algorithm and appro priate problem encodings based on

                  problems many times faster than the best current planning
                  systems. Although stochastic methods have been shown to be
                  very effective on a wide range of scheduling problems, this is
                  the first demonstration of its power on truly challenging

                  that the target variable (hypotheses) are logically distant
                  from the observable events (data). In this situation it may be
                  difficult or impossible to assess the probabilistic connection
                  between them, but it may be possible to decompose the problem
                  through the use of intermediate or explanatory variables. That
                  is, it will often be possible to assess the likelihood of the
                  observed data given some intermediate variable, and the
                  likelihood of that intermediate variable given another, and so
                  on, until the hypotheses of interest are reached. Inferences
                  which incorporate one or more intermediate variables are
                  called hierarchical, cascaded, or multistage inferences. The
                  present paper presents a normative model for the solution of
                  the general hierarchical inference problem. The formulation
                  begins with a formal description of the hierarchical inference
                  tree, including a discussion of various simplifying
                  conditional independence assumptions. The solution is first
                  derived for three special case models of differing structure,
                  and then the algorithm for the general solution is given for
                  two cases: one in which the conditional independence
                  assumptions have been made and one in which they have not.},

                  very occurance of behavioural adjustment after conflicts has
                  been questioned, along with suggestions that there is no

                  subsequent neural or behavioural adjustments in control. Using
                  the Stroop color naming task and controlling for repetition
                  effects, it is demonstrated that ACC conflict related activity
                  predicts both greater prefrontal activity and adjustment in
                  behaviour supporting a role of ACC conflict monitoring in the

  abstract =     {The basis of visually guided locomotion is the ambient optical
                  flow. Because animals with frontal eyes can sample only a
                  portion of the flow field, they must continuously scan in
                  order to be aware of their surroundings. Such scanning
                  introduces additional transformations of the retinal image,
                  apparently complicating the extraction from retinal flow of
                  the information in optical flow. In this study, the authors
                  conducted computer simulations of eye movement graphically.
                  These simulations revealed that when gaze direction coincides
                  with heading direction on curvilinear paths, velocity vectors
                  in the image plane become linearized. The active rotation of
                  the eyes is, in effect, an essential mechanism for extracting
                  the self-movement information contained in optical flow from
                  flow patterns on the retinas. Strategically positioning the
                  eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear and, thereby, converts a
                  complicated information pickup problem into a considerably
                  simpler problem. Based on these simulations, the authors
                  contend that heading direction is specified by the
                  perpendicularly aligned vectors.},

  abstract =     {Multi-view stereo methods frequently fail to properly
                  reconstruct 3D scene geometry if visible texture is sparse or
                  the scene exhibits difficult self-occlusions. Time-of-Flight
                  (ToF) depth sensors can provide 3D information regardless of
                  texture but with only limited resolution and accuracy. To find
                  an optimal reconstruction, we propose an integrated multi-view
                  sensor fusion approach that combines information from multiple
                  color cameras and multiple ToF depth sensors. First,
                  multi-view ToF sensor measurements are combined to obtain a
                  coarse but complete model. Then, the initial model is refined
                  by means of a probabilistic multi-view fusion framework,
                  optimizing over an energy function that aggregates ToF depth
                  sensor information with multi-view stereo and silhouette
                  constraints. We obtain high quality dense and detailed 3D
                  models of scenes challenging for stereo alone, while
                  simultaneously reducing complex noise of ToF sensors.},

  abstract =     {We present a real-time algorithm for foreground-background
                  segmentation. Sample background values at each pixel are
                  quantized into codebooks which represent a compressed form of
                  background model for a long image sequence. This allows us to
                  capture structural background variation due to periodic-like
                  motion over a long period of time under limited memory. The
                  codebook representation is efficient in memory and speed
                  compared with other background modeling techniques. Our method
                  can handle scenes containing moving backgrounds or
                  illumination variations, and it achieves robust detection for
                  different types of videos. We compared our method with other
                  multimode modeling techniques. In addition to the basic
                  algorithm, two features improving the algorithm are
                  presented-layered modeling/detection and adaptive codebook
                  updating. For performance evaluation, we have applied
                  perturbation detection rate analysis to four background
                  subtraction algorithms and two videos of different types of
                  scenes.},

  abstract =     {The ability to localise a camera moving in a previously
                  unknown environment is desirable for a wide range of
                  applications. In computer vision this problem is studied as
                  monocular SLAM. Recent years have seen improvements to the
                  usability and scalability of monocular SLAMsystems to the
                  point that they may soon find uses outside of laboratory
                  conditions. However, the robustness of these systems to rapid
                  camera motions (we refer to this quality as agility) still
                  lags behind that of tracking systems which use known object
                  models. In this paper we attempt to remedy this. We present
                  two approaches to improving the agility of a keyframe-based
                  SLAM system: Firstly, we add edge features to the map and
                  exploit their resilience to motion blur to improve tracking
                  under fast motion. Secondly, we implement a very simple
                  inter-frame rotation estimator to aid tracking when the camera
                  is rapidly panning � and demonstrate that this method also
                  enables a trivially simple yet effective relocalisation
                  method. Results show that a SLAM system combining points, edge
                  features and motion initialisation allows highly agile
                  tracking at a moderate increase in processing time.},

                  {Implementing} {Shifts} in {Selective} {Visual} {Attention}},
  abstract =     {This study addresses the question of how simple networks can
                  account for a variety of phenomena associated with the shift
                  of a specialized processing focus across the visual scene. We
                  address in particular aspects of the dichotomy between the
                  preattentive-parallel and the attentive-serial modes of visual
                  perception and their hypothetical neuronal implementations.
                  Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of
                  elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of
                  movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in
                  different topographical maps, called the early representation.
                  (2) There exists a selective mapping from this early
                  representation into a more central representation, such that
                  at any instant the central representation contains the
                  properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the
                  ıt selected location. (3) We discuss some selection rules that
                  determine which location will be mapped into the central
                  representation. The major rule, using the saliency or
                  conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is
                  implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. A
                  hierarchical pyramid–like architecture is proposed for this
                  network. We suggest possible implementations in neuronal
                  hardware, including a possible role for the extensive
                  back-projection form the cortex to the LGN.},

  abstract =     {Automatic symbolic traffic scene analysis is essen- tial to
                  many areas of IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle High- way Systems).
                  Traffic scene information can be used to optimize traffic flow
                  during busy periods, identify stalled vehicles and accidents,
                  and aid the decision- making of an autonomous vehicle
                  controller. Improve- ments in technologies for machine
                  vision-based surveil- lance and high-level symbolic reasoning
                  have enabled us to develop a system for detailed, reliable
                  traffic scene analysis. The machine vision component of our
                  system employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model
                  based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle trajectories over a
                  sequence of traffic scene images. The symbolic reasoning
                  component uses a dynamic belief network to make inferences
                  about traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and stalls.
                  In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of the vision and
                  reasoning components as well as their integration into a
                  working prototype. Prelim- inary results of an implementation
                  on special purpose hardware using C-40 Digital Signal
                  Processors show that near real-time performance can be
                  achieved with- out further improvements.},

                  vision can be used to generate matches. Other advantages of

                  meters, using thousands of poses. However, the computation to
                  construct the map grows as O(n log n), so larger maps get
                  increasingly difficult to build. We present an abstraction
                  method for postponing the growth in computation. This method
                  solves a much smaller problem in the space of the connection
                  graph of the map.},

  abstract =     {Motion estimation from imagery, sometimes called visual
                  odometry, is a well-known process. However, it is difficult to
                  achieve good performance using standard techniques. In this
                  paper, we present the results of several years of work on an
                  integrated system to localize a mobile robot in rough outdoor
                  terrain using visual odometry, with an increasing degree of
                  precision. We discuss issues that are important for realtime,
                  high-precision performance: choice of features, matching
                  strategies, incremental bundle adjustment, and filtering with
                  inertial measurement sensors. Using data with ground truth
                  from an RTK GPS system, we show experimentally that our
                  algorithms can track motion, in off-road terrain, over
                  distances of 10 km, with an error of less than 10 m (0.1\%).},

                  efficiently exploited for image based rendering as well as

                  present an approach for automatic extraction of dominant
                  rectangular structures from a single view and show how they
                  facilitate the recovery of camera pose, planar structure and
                  matching across widely separated views. In the presented
                  approach the rectangular hypothesis formation is based on a
                  higher level information encoded by the presence of orthogonal
                  vanishing directions, the dominant rectangular structures can
                  be detected and matched despite the presence of multiple
                  repetitive structures often encountered in a variety of
                  buildings. Different stages of the approach are demonstrated

                  simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) for a mobile
                  robot in an unstructured indoor environment is presented in
                  this paper. Variations to standard PF are proposed to remedy
                  the sample impoverishment problem in bearing-only SLAM. A CCD
                  camera mounted on the robot is used as the measuring device
                  and image quality is incorporated into data association, PF
                  update and map management. A passive path control strategy to
                  maintain the accuracy of the SLAM process is also illustrated.
                  Experimental results from an implementation using real-life
                  data acquired from a Pioneer robot are included to demonstrate
                  the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract =     {The computational complexity of SLAM is dominated by the cost
                  of factorizing a matrix derived from the measurements into a
                  square root form, which has cubic complexity in the worst
                  case. However, the matrices associated with the full SLAM
                  problem are typically very sparse, as opposed to the dense
                  problems one obtains in a filtering context. Hence much
                  faster, sparse factorization algorithms can be used.
                  Furthermore, the cost can be further reduced by choosing a
                  good order in which to eliminate variables during the
                  factorization process, leading to more or less fill-in. In
                  particular, in this paper we investigate how a nested
                  dissection ordering method can provably improve the
                  performance of the full SLAM algorithm. We show that the
                  computational complexity for the factorization of a large
                  class of measurement matrices occurring in the SLAM problem
                  can be tightly bound under reasonable assumptions.},

                  many variables often exploit the manner in which the given
                  functions factor as a product of `local' functions, each of
                  which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a
                  factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we
                  call a factor graph. In this tutorial paper, we present a
                  generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm,
                  that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple
                  computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes—either
                  exactly or approximately—various marginal functions derived
                  from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms

  abstract =     {The "Map in the Head" metaphor states that knowledge of
                  large-scale space is isomorphic to the information stored in a
                  graphical map: That is, corresponding operations are used to
                  store and retrieve information. The purpose of this essay is
                  to look carefully at the "Map in the Head" metaphor to see the
                  limits of its applicability. There are two types of
                  experimental results that are difficult to accommodate within
                  this metaphor. First, instead of being integrated into a
                  single map, spatial knowledge can fall into disconnected
                  components, with little or no relation between the components.
                  Second, knowledge of routes (and other spatial facts) may be
                  represented asymmetrically, so that a route can be followed in
                  one direction but not in the other. The first set of results
                  leads us to replace the simple "Map in the Head" with a more
                  complex and sophisticated metaphor including separate metrical
                  and topological components. The second set of results suggests
                  that even the more sophisticated "Map in the Head" is built
                  from computational structures that occasionally reveal their
                  nonmaplike properties. A computational model is presented for
                  assimilating observations gathered during travel, first into a
                  description of the particular route, then into representations
                  for the topological and metrical features of the environment.},

  title =        {Representing {Knowledge} of {Large}-{Scale} {Space}},
  abstract =     {This dissertation presents a model of the knowledge a person
                  has about the spatial structure of a large-scale environment:
                  the “cognitive map.” The functions of the cognitive map are to
                  assimilate new information about the environment, to represent
                  the current position, and to answer route-finding and
                  relative-position problems. This model (called the TOUR model)
                  analyzes the cognitive map in terms of symbolic descriptions
                  of the environment and operations on those descriptions.
                  Knowledge about a particular environment is represented in
                  terms of route descriptions, a topological network of paths
                  and places, multiple frames of reference for relative
                  positions, dividing boundaries, and a structure of containing
                  regions. The current position is described by the “You Are
                  Here” pointer, which acts as a working memory and a focus of
                  attention. Operations on the cognitive map are performed by
                  inference rules which act to transfer information among
                  different descriptions and the “You Are Here” pointer. The
                  TOUR model shows how the particular descriptions chosen to
                  represent spatial knowledge support assimilation of new
                  information from local observations into the cognitive map,
                  and how the cognitive map solves route-finding and
                  relative-position problems. A central theme of this research
                  is that the states of partial knowledge supported by a
                  representation are responsible for its ability to function
                  with limited information or computational resources. The
                  representations in the TOUR model provide a rich collection of
                  states of partial knowledge, and therefore exhibit flexible,
                  “common-sense” behavior.},

  abstract =     {The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy is a model of knowledge of
                  large-scale space consisting of multiple interacting
                  representations, both qualitative and quantitative. The SSH is
                  inspired by the properties of the human cognitive map, and is
                  intended to serve both as a model of the human cognitive map
                  and as a method for robot exploration and map-building. The
                  multiple levels of the SSH express states of partial
                  knowledge, and thus enable the human or robotic agent to deal
                  robustly with uncertainty during both learning and
                  problem-solving. The control level represents useful patterns
                  of sensorimotor interaction with the world in the form of
                  trajectory-following and hill-climbing control laws leading to
                  locally distinctive states. Local geometric maps in local
                  frames of reference can be constructed at the control level to
                  serve as observers for control laws in particular
                  neighborhoods. The causal level abstracts continuous behavior
                  among distinctive states into a discrete model consisting of
                  states linked by actions. The topological level introduces the
                  external ontology of places, paths and regions by abduction,
                  to explain the observed pattern of states and actions at the
                  causal level. Quantitative knowledge at the control, causal
                  and topological levels supports a ?atchworkmap?of local
                  geometric frames of reference linked by causal and topological
                  connections. The patchwork map can be merged into a single
                  global frame of reference at the metrical level when
                  sufficient information and computational resources are
                  available. We describe the assumptions and guarantees behind
                  the generality of the SSH across environments and sensorimotor
                  systems. Evidence is presented from several partial
                  implementations of the SSH on simulated and physical robots.},

                  including various types of simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA) can be phrased as
                  least squares optimization of an error function that can be
                  represented by a graph. This paper describes the general
                  structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source
                  C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error
                  functions. Our system has been designed to be easily
                  extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem
                  typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current
                  implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM
                  and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world
                  and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while
                  being general g2o offers a performance comparable to
                  implementations of state-of-the-art approaches for the

  abstract =     {A number of positioning identification techniques have been
                  used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is a popular method,
                  but is not reliable when a robot travels long distances or
                  over an uneven surface because of variations in wheel diameter
                  and wheel slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the
                  current position relative to landmarks, cannot be used in an
                  uncharted environment. The authors propose a new method called
                  ?�cooperative positioning with multiple robots?? For
                  cooperative positioning, the authors divide the robots into
                  two groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains stationary and
                  acts as a landmark while group B moves. The moving group B
                  then stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This
                  ?�dance??is repeated until the target robot position are
                  reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower accumulated
                  positioning error than dead reckoning, and can work in
                  three-dimensions which is not possible with dead reckoning.
                  Also, this method has inherent landmarks and therefore works
                  in uncharted environments. This paper discusses the
                  positioning accuracy of the authors' method with error

  abstract =     {This paper presents a multiple hypothesis approach to solve
                  the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem with
                  a bearing-only sensor. The main contribution of the paper is
                  to provide a remedy for the landmark initialisation problem
                  that occurs due to the absence of range information, in a
                  computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is initialised
                  in the form of multiple hypotheses distributed along the
                  direction of the bearing measurement. Using subsequent
                  measurements, the validity of the hypotheses is evaluated
                  based on the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT).
                  Consequently, the best approximation to the landmark location
                  is maintained. This approach enables an extended Kalman filler
                  (EKF) to be used for bearing-only SLAM providing a
                  computational efficient solution. Simulation and experimental
                  results, from using a camera as the bearing-only sensor
                  mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to demonstrate the
                  effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

  abstract =     {Order picking is a logistics component of warehouse operations
                  where substantial productivity gains are possible. In this
                  study, we investigate implementation processes of
                  collaborative order picking robots (cobots) and focus on the
                  influence of human factors on their implementation in high
                  volume distribution centres. These human factors are:
                  resistance to change; organisational culture; communication on
                  change; and leadership. Four case companies were selected that
                  have experience with testing and introducing several types of
                  cobot and have successfully implemented (at least) one type of
                  cobot over an extended period. In-depth interviews with
                  operational decision-makers led to the identification of 66
                  critical incidents related to human factors. The results
                  demonstrate the importance of planning the implementation
                  process in phases. Employees are hesitant or resistant to the
                  change due to a lack of information, experience, and
                  communication. The decisive role of the team leader is crucial
                  to implement cobots successfully, and here the individual
                  character traits (e.g., the variance in commitment, character,
                  and motivation) influence the process as well. Although the
                  introduction of cobots is not yet widespread, and the negative
                  impact on the workforce (i.e., concerning job loss) is
                  currently low, one should be aware of the possible future
                  implications when robotisation becomes structurally embedded.
                  Therefore, this article calls for a stronger link between
                  human factors and the future of work, with a specific focus on
                  reskilling and upskilling of logistics professionals in light
                  of robotisation, rather than binary approaches in which robots
                  are primarily seen as a threat to the current workforce.},

  volume =       185,
  abstract =     {Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                  movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                  with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                  movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                  in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                  gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                  results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                  Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                  about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                  insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                  rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                  need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                  imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                  third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                  prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                  which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                  of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                  and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                  jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which

  abstract =     {Large changes in the direction of gaze are made with a
                  combination of fast saccadic eye movements and rather slower
                  head movements. Since the first study on freely moving
                  subjects, most authors have agreed that the head movement
                  component of gaze is very variable, with a high 'volitional'
                  component. But in some circumstances head and eye movements
                  can be quite predictable, for example when a subject is asked
                  to shift gaze as quickly as possible. Under these conditions,
                  laboratory studies have shown that the eye and head
                  motor-systems both receive gaze-change commands, although they
                  execute them in rather different ways. Here I reconsider the
                  way gaze direction is changed during free movement, but in the
                  performance of a task where the subject is too busy to exert
                  conscious control over head or eye movements. Using a new
                  portable and inexpensive method for recording head and eye
                  movements, I examine the oculomotor behaviour of car drivers,
                  particularly during the large gaze changes made at road
                  junctions. The results show that the pattern of eye and head
                  movements is highly preditable, given only the sequence of
                  gaze targets.},

  volume =       41,
  abstract =     {Two recent studies have investigated the relations of eye and
                  hand movements in extended food preparation tasks, and here
                  the results are compared. The tasks could be divided into a
                  series of actions performed on objects. The eyes usually
                  reached the next object in the sequence before any sign of
                  manipulative action, indicating that eye movements are planned
                  into the motor pattern and lead each action. The eyes usually
                  fixated the same object throughout the action upon it,
                  although they often moved on to the next object in the
                  sequence before completion of the preceding action. The
                  specific roles of individual fixations could be identified as
                  locating (establishing the locations of objects for future
                  use), directing (establishing target direction prior to
                  contact), guiding (supervising the relative movements of two
                  or three objects) and checking (establishing whether some
                  particular condition is met, prior to the termination of an
                  action). It is argued that, at the beginning of each action,
                  the oculomotor system is supplied with the identity of the
                  required object, information about its location, and
                  instructions about the nature of the monitoring required
                  during the action. The eye movements during this kind of task
                  are nearly all to task-relevant objects, and thus their
                  control is seen as primarily ?op-down? and influenced very
                  little by the ?ntrinsic salience?of objects.},

                  pattern of the road ahead. There are many theories about what
                  features a driver might use, and recent attempts to engineer
                  self-steering vehicles have sharpened interest in the
                  mechanisms involved. However, there is little direct
                  information linking steering performance to the driver's
                  direction of gaze. We have made simultaneous recordings of
                  steering-wheel angle and drivers' gaze direction during a
                  series of drives along a tortuous road. We found that drivers
                  rely particularly on the 'tangent point' on the inside of each
                  curve, seeking this point 1? s before each bend and returning
                  to it throughout the bend. The direction of this point
                  relative to the car's heading predicts the curvature of the

  abstract =     {This paper establishes a general framework for Bayesian
                  model-based clustering, in which subset labels are
                  exchangeable, and items are also exchangeable, possibly up to
                  covariate effects. It is rich enough to encompass a variety of
                  existing procedures, including some recently discussed
                  methodologies involving stochastic search or hierarchical
                  clustering, but more importantly allows the formulation of
                  clustering procedures that are optimal with respect to a
                  specified loss function. Our focus is on loss functions based
                  on pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of items are
                  clustered into the same subset or not. Optimisation of the
                  posterior expected loss function can be formulated as a binary
                  integer programming problem, which can be readily solved, for
                  example by the simplex method, when clustering a modest number
                  of items, but quickly becomes impractical as problem scale
                  increases. To combat this, a new heuristic item-swapping

  abstract =     {Adaptive Gaussian mixtures have been used for modeling
                  nonstationary temporal distributions of pixels in video
                  surveillance applications. However, a common problem for this
                  approach is balancing between model convergence speed and
                  stability. This paper proposes an effective scheme to improve
                  the convergence rate without compromising model stability.
                  This is achieved by replacing the global, static retention
                  factor with an adaptive learning rate calculated for each
                  Gaussian at every frame. Significant improvements are shown on
                  both synthetic and real video data. Incorporating this
                  algorithm into a statistical framework for background
                  subtraction leads to an improved segmentation performance
                  compared to a standard method.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents an algorithm for autonomous map building
                  and maintenance for a mobile robot. We believe that mobile
                  robot navigation can be treated as a problem of tracking
                  geometric features which occur naturally in the environment.
                  We represent each feature in the map by a location estimate
                  (the feature state vector) and two distinct measures of
                  uncertainty: a covariance matrix to represent uncertainty in
                  feature location, and a credibility measure to represent our
                  belief in the validity of the feature. During each position
                  update cycle, predicted measurements are generated for each
                  geometric feature in the map and compared to actual sensor
                  observations. Successful matches cause a feature's credibility
                  to be increased. Unpredicted observations are used to
                  initialize new geometric features, while unobserved
                  predictions result in a geometric feature's credibility being
                  decreased. We describe experimental results obtained with the
                  algorithm that demonstrate successful map building using real

  abstract =     {This paper presents our recently developed approach to
                  constructing a hierarchical representation of visual input
                  that aims to enable recognition and detection of a large
                  number of object categories. Inspired by the principles of
                  efficient indexing, robust matching, and ideas of
                  compositionality, our approach learns a hierarchy of spatially
                  flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an unsupervised,
                  statistics-driven manner. Starting with simple, frequent
                  features, we learn the statistically most significant
                  compositions (parts composed of parts), which consequently
                  define the next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer
                  after layer, optimally adjusting to the visual data. Lower
                  layers are learned in a category-independent way to obtain
                  complex, yet sharable visual building blocks, which is a
                  crucial step towards a scalable representation. Higher layers
                  of the hierarchy, on the other hand, are constructed by using
                  specific categories, achieving a category representation with
                  a small number of highly generalizable parts that gained their
                  structural flexibility through composition within the
                  hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can be
                  efficiently and continuously added to the system by adding a
                  small number of parts only in the higher layers. The approach
                  is demonstrated on a large collection of images and a variety
                  of object categories.},

                  behavioral parameterization in the framework of a Case-Based
                  Reasoning methodology for autonomous navigation tasks. It is
                  based on our previous work on a behavior-based robotic system
                  that also employed spatio-temporal case-based reasoning in the
                  selection of behavioral parameters but was not capable of
                  learning new parameterizations. The present method extends the
                  case-based reasoning module by making it capable of learning
                  new and optimizing the existing cases where each case is a set
                  of behavioral parameters. The learning process can either be a
                  separate training process or be part of the mission execution.
                  In either case, the robot learns an optimal parameterization
                  of its behavior for different environments it encounters. The
                  goal of this research is not only to automatically optimize
                  the performance of the robot but also to avoid the manual
                  configuration of behavioral parameters and the initial
                  configuration of a case library, both of which require the
                  user to possess good knowledge of robot behavior and the
                  performance of numerous experiments. The presented method was
                  integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and evaluated in
                  extensive computer simulations, showing a significant increase
                  in the performance over a nonadaptive system and a performance
                  comparable to a non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded
                  case library.},

  abstract =     {Mobile robot map building is the task of generating a model of
                  an environment from sensor data. Most existing approaches to
                  mobile robot mapping either build topological representations
                  or generate accurate, metric maps of an environment. In this
                  paper we introduce relational object maps, a novel approach to
                  building metric maps that represent individual objects such as
                  doors or walls. We show how to extend relational Markov
                  networks in order to reason about a hierarchy of objects and
                  the spatial relationships between them. Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo is used for ef cient inference and to learn the
                  parameters of the model. We show that the spatial constraints
                  modeled by our mapping technique yield drastic improvements
                  for labeling line segments extracted from laser rangefinders.},

                  in Bayesian belief networks that derives significant
                  advantages from focused inference and relevance reasoning.
                  This framework is based on d -separation and other simple and
                  computationally efficient techniques for pruning irrelevant
                  parts of a network. Our main contribution is a technique that
                  we call relevance-based decomposition. Relevance-based
                  decomposition approaches belief updating in large networks by
                  focusing on their parts and decomposing them into partially
                  overlapping subnetworks. This makes reasoning in some
                  intractable networks possible and, in addition, often results
                  in significant speedup, as the total time taken to update all
                  subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the
                  time taken to update the network as a whole. We report results
                  of empirical tests that demonstrate practical significance of
                  our approach.},

  abstract =     {J. A. George {\textbackslash}citeGeorge73siam has discovered a
                  method, called nested dissection, for solving a system of
                  linear equations defined on an n = k {\textbackslash}times k
                  square grid in O(n {\textbackslash}log n) and space
                  O(n{\textasciicircum}3/2) time. We generalize this method
                  without degrading the time and space bounds so that it applies
                  to any system of equations defined on a planar or
                  almost-planar graph. Such systems arise in the solution of
                  two-dimensional finite element problems. Our method uses the
                  fact that planar graphs have good separators. More generally,
                  we show that sparse Gaussian elimination is efficient for any
                  class of graphs which have good separators, and conversely
                  that graphs without good separators (including "almost all"
                  sparse graphs) are not amenable to sparse Gaussian
                  elimination.},

                  operations in sparse matrix computation is the minimum-degree
                  algorithm. The notion of multiple elimination is introduced
                  here as a modification to the conventional scheme. The
                  motivation is discussed using the k{\textbackslash}times k
                  grid model problem. Experimental results indicate that the
                  modified version retains the fill-reducing property of (and is
                  often better than) the original ordering algorithm and yet
                  requires less computer time. The reduction in ordering time is
                  problem dependent, and for some problems the modified
                  algorithm can run a few times faster than existing
                  implementations of the minimum-degree algorithm. The use of
                  external degree in the algorithm is also introduced.},

                  complete theoretical treatment for 2D wallpaper groups under
                  affine transformations. For the first time, a given periodic
                  pattern can be classified not simply by its Euclidean symmetry
                  group but,by its highest
                  {\textbackslash}tt"potential{\textbackslash}tt" symmetry group
                  under affine deformation. A concise wallpaper group migration
                  map is constructed that separates the 17 affinely deformed
                  wallpaper groups into small, distinct orbits. The practical
                  value of this result includes a novel indexing and retrieval
                  scheme for regular patterns, and a maximal-symmetry-based
                  method for estimating shape and orientation from texture under
                  unknown views.},

  abstract =     {This paper explores the fusion of inertial information with
                  vision for 3D reconstruction. A method is proposed for
                  vertical line segment detection and subsequent local geometric
                  map building. Visual and inertial sensing are two sensory
                  modalities that can be explored to give robust solutions on
                  image segmentation and recovery of 3D structure from images,
                  increasing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and
                  enlarging the application potential of vision systems. From
                  the inertial sensors, a camera stereo rig, and a few system
                  parameters we can recover the 3D parameters of the ground
                  plane and vertical lines. The homography between stereo images
                  of ground points can be found. By detecting the vertical line
                  segments in each image, and using the homography of ground
                  points for the foot of each segment, the lines can be matched
                  and reconstructed in 3D. The mobile robot then maps the
                  detected vertical line segments in a world map as it moves. To
                  build this map an outlier removal method is implemented and a
                  statistical approach used, so that a simplified metric map can
                  be obtained for robot navigation.},

  abstract =     {A robot exploring an unknown environment may need to build a
                  world model from sensor measurements. In order to integrate
                  all the frames of sensor data, it is essential to align the
                  data properly. An incremental approach has been typically used
                  in the past, in which each local frame of data is aligned to a
                  cumulative global model, and then merged to the model. Because
                  dierent parts of the model are updated independently while
                  there are errors in the registration, such an approach may
                  result in an inconsistent model. In this paper, we study the
                  problem of consistent registration of multiple frames of
                  measurements (range scans), together with the related issues
                  of representation and manipulation of spatial uncertainties.
                  Our approach is to maintain all the local frames of data as
                  well as the relative spatial relationships between local
                  frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as random
                  variables and are derived from matching pairwise scans or from
                  odometry. Then we formulate a procedure based on the maximum
                  likelihood criterion to optimally combine all the spatial
                  relations. Consistency is achieved by using all the spatial
                  relations as constraints to solve for the data frame poses
                  simultaneously. Experiments with both simulated and real data
                  will be presented.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we present a novel method to fuse observations
                  from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual sensors,
                  such that initial conditions of the inertial integration,
                  including gravity estimation, can be recovered quickly and in
                  a linear manner, thus removing any need for special
                  initialization procedures. The algorithm is implemented using
                  a graphical simultaneous localization and mapping like
                  approach that guarantees constant time output. This paper
                  discusses the technical aspects of the work, including
                  observability and the ability for the system to estimate scale
                  in real time. Results are presented of the system, estimating
                  the platforms position, velocity, and attitude, as well as
                  gravity vector and sensor alignment and calibration on-line in
                  a built environment. This paper discusses the system setup,
                  describing the real-time integration of the IMU data with
                  either stereo or monocular vision data. We focus on human
                  motion for the purposes of emulating high-dynamic motion, as
                  well as to provide a localization system for future

                  to task two other processes that is the invariant monitoring
                  process and the goal monitoring process. The notion of
                  invariants was also used by Donald. Ecah control strategy has
                  it's own invariant. Lyons showed how the invariants can be
                  composed based on composition operators. Invariants handle
                  only error monitoring. The recovery is done by chaining the
                  recovery with the monitoring procedure}

                  demands for a given problem. In principle, partitioned
                  sampling is a statistical analogy
                  {\textbackslash}emphhierarchical search. Articulated objects
                  are therefore suitable in particular for this kind of
                  (multi-)object tracker. Besides partitioned sampling, the
                  paper introduces the notion of {\textbackslash}emphsurvival
                  diagnostics and {\textbackslash}emphsurvival rate. Both
                  quantities can be used for assessing the efficacy of a

                  {\textbackslash}empheffective sample set size
                  {\textbackslash}citedoucet:02:a – measures the effective
                  sample set size which has to be within the boundaries of 1
                  (one sample has weight 1 all others have weight 0) and n (all
                  samples have equal weight 1/n). The survival rate is a
                  property of a given sample set meassuring the over-all
                  tracking performance. More technical details about partitioned
                  sampling for hand tracking can be found in

  abstract =     {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway
                  with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial
                  use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments,
                  there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots
                  share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable
                  architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The
                  Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last
                  chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely
                  available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1
                  was not designed with many necessary production-grade features
                  and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been
                  redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth
                  by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at
                  all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and
                  architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in
                  the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the
                  influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real
                  robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of
                  challenging environments. This Review describes ROS 2’s
                  design, features, and performance with four case studies on
                  land, air, sea, and even space.},

  abstract =     {In this paper we present a junction tree based inference
                  architecture exploiting the structure of the original Bayesian
                  network and independence relations induced by evidence to
                  improve the efficiency of inference. The efficiency
                  improvements are obtained by maintaining a multiplicative
                  decomposition of clique and separator potentials. Maintaining
                  a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator
                  potentials offers a tradeoff between off-line constructed
                  junction trees and on-line exploitation of barren variables
                  and independence relations induced by evidence. We consider
                  the impact of the proposed architecture on a number of
                  commonly performed Bayesian network tasks. The tasks we
                  consider include cautious propagation of evidence, determining
                  a most probable configuration, and fast retraction of evidence
                  a long with a number of other tasks. The general impression is
                  that the proposed architecture increases the computational
                  efficiency of performing these tasks. The efficiency
                  improvement offered by the proposed architecture is emphasized
                  through empirical evaluations involving large real-world
                  Bayesian networks. We compare the time and space performance
                  of the proposed architecture with non-optimized
                  implementations of the HUGIN and Shafer-Shenoy inference

  abstract =     {This paper presents a simultaneous localization and mapping
                  algorithm suitable for large-scale visual navigation. The
                  estimation process is based on the viewpoint augmented
                  navigation (VAN) framework using an extended information
                  filter. Cholesky factorization modifications are used to
                  maintain a factor of the VAN information matrix, enabling
                  efficient recovery of state estimates and covariances. The
                  algorithm is demonstrated using data acquired by an autonomous
                  underwater vehicle performing a visual survey of sponge beds.

  abstract =     {The paper presents an algorithm for Bayesian decentralized
                  data fusion (BDDF) and its extension to information-theoretic
                  control. The algorithm is stated for a feature represented by
                  a general probability density function. Several specific
                  representations are then considered – Gaussian, discrete,
                  Certainty Grid, and hybrid. Well known algorithms for these
                  representations are shown to fit the general BDDF pattern.
                  Stating the algorithms in Bayesian terms has a practical
                  advantage of allowing a generic software implementation. It is
                  also hoped that a clear general formulation will stimulate
                  extensions to efficient non-parametric representations of
                  arbitrary distributions. The algorithms are described in the
                  context of the Active Sensor Network architecture – a modular
                  framework for decentralized cooperative data fusion and
                  control. The approach is illustrated with the results of two
                  deployment scenarios with an indoor sensor network.},

  abstract =     {Based on a recent development in the area of error control
                  coding, we introduce the notion of convolutional factor graphs
                  (CFGs) as a new class of probabilistic graphical models. In
                  this context, the conventional factor graphs are referred to
                  as multiplicative factor graphs (MFGs). This paper shows that
                  CFGs are natural models for probability functions when
                  summation of independent latent random variables is involved.
                  In particular, CFGs capture a large class of linear models,
                  where the linearity is in the sense that the observed
                  variables are obtained as a linear transformation of the
                  latent variables taking arbitrary distributions. We use
                  Gaussian models and independent factor models as examples to
                  demonstrate the use of CFGs. The requirement of a linear
                  transformation between latent variables (with certain
                  independence restriction) and the observed variables, to an
                  extent, limits the modelling flexibility of CFGs. This
                  structural restriction however provides a powerful analytic
                  tool to the framework of CFGs; that is, upon taking the
                  Fourier transform of the function represented by the CFG, the
                  resulting function is represented by a MFG with identical
                  structure. This Fourier transform duality allows inference
                  problems on a CFG to be solved on the corresponding dual MFG.},

  abstract =     {We introduce a new method for stereo visual SLAM (simultaneous
                  localization and mapping) that works in unstructured, outdoor
                  environments. Observations use dense stereo vision to measure
                  the variance of the heights in each cell of a 2D grid. Unlike
                  other grid-based SLAM algorithms, which use occupancy grid
                  maps, our algorithm uses a new mapping technique that
                  maintains a posterior distribution over the height variance in
                  each cell. To obtain a joint posterior over poses and maps, we
                  use a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter: the pose distribution
                  is estimated using a particle filter, and each particle has
                  its own map that is obtained through exact filtering
                  conditioned on the particle? pose. For the particle filter
                  over pose, visual odometry (VO) provides good proposal
                  distributions. In the analytical (exact) filter for the map,
                  we update the sufficient statistics of a gamma distribution
                  over the precision (inverse variance) of heights in each grid
                  cell. We demonstrate performance on two outdoor courses, and
                  verify the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing with ground
                  truth data obtained using electronic surveying equipment.},

  abstract =     {Moving cast shadows are a major concern for foreground
                  detection algorithms. Processing of foreground images in
                  surveillance applications typically requires that such shadows
                  have been identified and removed from the detected foreground.
                  This paper presents a novel pixel-based statistical approach
                  to model moving cast shadows of non-uniform and varying
                  intensity. This approach uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
                  learning ability to build statistical models describing moving
                  cast shadows on surfaces. This statistical modeling can deal
                  with scenes with complex and time-varying illumination, and
                  prevent false detection in regions where shadows cannot be
                  detected. Gaussian mixture shadow models (GMSM) are
                  automatically constructed and updated over time, are easily
                  added to a GMM architecture for foreground detection, and
                  require only a small number of parameters. Results obtained
                  with different scene types show the robustness of the
                  approach.},

                  reconstruction through visual tracking with a single viewpoint
                  sensor and in particular how to generalise tracking to
                  calibrated omnidirectional cameras.We analyse different
                  minimisation approaches for the intensity-based cost function
                  (sum-ofsquared differences). In particular, we propose novel
                  variants of the efficient second-order minimisation (ESM) with
                  better computational complexities and compare these algorithms
                  with the inverse composition (IC) and the hyperplane
                  approximation (HA). Issues regarding the use of the IC and HA
                  for 3-D tracking are discussed. We show that even though an
                  iteration of ESM is more computationally expensive than an
                  iteration of IC, the faster convergence rate makes it globally
                  faster. The tracking algorithm was validated using an
                  omnidirectional sensor mounted on a mobile robot.},

                  descriptors derived from multiple views of a scene,
                  incorporating illumination and viewpoint variations. These
                  descriptors are extracted from video and then applied to the
                  challenging task of wide baseline matching across significant
                  viewpoint changes. The system incorporates a single camera on
                  a mobile robot in an extended Kalman filter framework to
                  develop a 3D map of the environment and determine egomotion.
                  At the same time, the feature descriptors are generated from
                  the video sequence, which can be used to localize the robot
                  when it returns to a mapped location. The kidnapped robot
                  problem is addressed by matching descriptors without any
                  estimate of position, then determining the epipolar geometry
                  with respect to a known position in the map.},

  abstract =     {Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are a rapidly growing area of
                  research and development in robotics. For autonomous robot
                  operations, localization has typically been calculated using
                  GPS, external camera arrays, or onboard range or vision
                  sensing. In cluttered indoor or outdoor environments, onboard
                  sensing is the only viable option. In this paper we present an
                  appearance-based approach to visual SLAM on a flying MAV using
                  only low quality vision. Our approach consists of a visual
                  place recognition algorithm that operates on 1000 pixel
                  images, a lightweight visual odometry algorithm, and a visual
                  expectation algorithm that improves the recall of place
                  sequences and the precision with which they are recalled as
                  the robot flies along a similar path. Using data gathered from
                  outdoor datasets, we show that the system is able to perform
                  visual recognition with low quality, intermittent visual
                  sensory data. By combining the visual algorithms with the
                  RatSLAM system, we also demonstrate how the algorithms enable
                  successful SLAM.},

  title =        {{SeqSLAM}: {Visual} route-based navigation for sunny summer
                  days and stormy winter nights},
  abstract =     {Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled
                  during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and
                  in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art
                  algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we
                  present a new approach to visual navigation under changing
                  conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single
                  location most likely given a current image, our approach
                  calculates the best candidate matching location within every
                  local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by
                  recognizing coherent sequences of these \#x201C;local best
                  matches \#x201D;. This approach removes the need for global
                  matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must
                  only pick the best match within any short sequence of images.
                  The approach is applicable over environment changes that
                  render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using
                  two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the
                  effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the
                  most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The
                  perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated
                  traverses through environments during the day and then in the
                  middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and
                  in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy
                  rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based
                  algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100\%
                  precision with recall rates of up to 60\%.},

                  identification and modeling of human actions embedded in a
                  larger sensor stream. Activity discovery can be seen as the
                  inverse of the activity recognition problem. Rather than learn
                  models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to discover
                  motifs, sets of similar subsequences within the raw sensor
                  stream, without the benefit of labels or manual segmentation.
                  These motifs are statistically unlikely and thus typically
                  correspond to important or characteristic actions within the
                  activity. The problem of activity discovery differs from
                  typical motif discovery, such as locating protein binding
                  sites, because of the nature of time series data representing
                  human activity. For example, in activity data, motifs will
                  tend to be sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only
                  exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate time warping.
                  In this paper, we motivate the activity discovery problem and
                  present our approach for efficient discovery of meaningful
                  actions from sensor data representing human activity. We
                  empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise data set
                  captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis inertial sensor. Our
                  algorithm successfully discovers motifs that correspond to the
                  real exercises with a recall rate of 96.3 percent and overall
                  accuracy of 86.7 percent over six exercises and 864

                  extended activity can benefit from a detailed description of

                  grammars allow for an efficient representation of such
                  expectations and are well-suited for the specification of
                  temporally well-ordered activities. In this paper, we extend
                  stochastic grammars by adding event parameters, state checks,

                  systems. Existing work in the area has mostly addressed scenes
                  that consist of static or quasi-static structures. When the
                  scene exhibits a persistent dynamic behavior in time, such an
                  assumption is violated and detection performance deteriorates.
                  In this paper, we propose a new method for the modeling and
                  subtraction of such scenes. Towards the modeling of the
                  dynamic characteristics, optical flow is computed and utilized
                  as a feature in a higher dimensional space. Inherent
                  ambiguities in the computation of features are addressed by
                  using a data-dependent bandwidth for density estimation using
                  kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the utility and
                  performance of the proposed approach.},

                  The goal of this research is semantic scene categorization for
                  CBIR. Through a set of psychophysical experiments the authors
                  identify two main axis of human categorization: human vs.
                  non-human and natural vs. man-made. From these main axis,
                  after more experiments, a set of 20 scene categories that seem
                  consistent to the subjects evolve. The subjects are asked to
                  find attributes and semantic descriptors for each of those
                  categories. In a next step these semantic features (e.g. "busy
                  scene") are translated to image-processing features (e.g.
                  "high spatial frequencies"). The image-processing features are
                  used to automatically classify unseen scenes into the semantic
                  categories. The results are mainly qualitatively, but quite
                  interesting. Unfortunately, the paper hasn't been published
                  officially yet. I just got a copy by the authors.}

  abstract =     {Background modeling and subtraction is a core compo- nent in
                  motion analysis. The central idea behind such module is to
                  create a probabilistic representation of the static scene that
                  is compared with the current input to perform subtraction.
                  Such approach is efficient when the scene to be modeled refers
                  to a static structure with limited perturbation. In this
                  paper, we address the problem of modeling dynamic scenes where
                  the assumption of a static background is not valid. Waving
                  trees, beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or snow
                  are examples. We propose an on-line auto-regressive model to
                  capture and predict the behavior of such scenes. Towards
                  detection of events we introduce a new metric that is based on
                  a state-driven comparison between the prediction and the
                  actual frame. Promising results demonstrate the potentials of
                  the proposed framework.},

  abstract =     {The problem of representation and handling of constraints is
                  here considered, mainly for picture processing purposes. A
                  systematic specification and utilization of the available
                  constraints could significantly reduce the amount of search in
                  picture recognition. On the other hand, formally stated
                  constraints can be embedded in the syntactic productions of
                  picture languages. Only binary constraints are treated here,
                  but they are represented in full generality as binary
                  relations. Constraints among more than two variables are then
                  represented as networks of simultaneous binary relations. In
                  general, more than one equivalent (i.e., representing the same
                  constraint) network can be found: a minimal equivalent network
                  is shown to exist, and its computation is shown to solve most
                  practical problems about constraint handling. No exact
                  solution for this central problem was found. Anyway,
                  constraints are treated algebraically, and the solution of a
                  system of linear equations in this algebra provides an
                  approximation of the minimal network. This solution is then
                  proved exact in special cases, e.g., for tree-like and
                  series-parallel networks and for classes of relations for
                  which a distributive property holds. This latter condition is
                  satisfied in cases of practical interest.},

  abstract =     {Recent work has shown that the probabilistic SLAM approach of
                  explicit uncertainty propagation can succeed in permitting
                  repeatable 3D real-time localization and mapping even in the
                  'pure vision' domain of a single agile camera with no extra
                  sensing. An issue which has caused difficulty in monocular
                  SLAM however is the initialization of features, since
                  information from multiple images acquired during motion must
                  be combined to achieve accurate depth estimates. This has led
                  algorithms to deviate from the desirable Gaussian uncertainty
                  representation of the EKF and related probabilistic filters
                  during special initialization steps. In this paper we present
                  a new unified parametrization for point features within
                  monocular SLAM which permits efficient and accurate
                  representation of uncertainty during undelayed initialisation
                  and beyond, all within the standard EKF (Extended Kalman
                  Filter). The key concept is direct parametrization of inverse
                  depth, where there is a high degree of linearity. Importantly,
                  our parametrization can cope with features which are so far
                  from the camera that they present little parallax during
                  motion, maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty that
                  these points retain the opportunity to 'come in' from infinity
                  if the camera makes larger movements. We demonstrate the
                  parametrization using real image sequences of large-scale
                  indoor and outdoor scenes.},

                  challenges due to the various uncertainties in the robot
                  sensing and action. In particular, global positioning sensors
                  of outdoor robots do not always work perfectly, causing large
                  drift in the location estimate of the robot. To overcome this
                  common problem, we propose a new approach for global
                  localization using place recognition. First, we learn the
                  location of some arbitrary key places using odometry
                  measurements and GPS measurements only at the start and the
                  end of the robot trajectory. In subsequent runs, when the
                  robot perceives a key place, our fixed-lag smoother fuses
                  odometry measurements with the relative location to the key
                  place to improve its pose estimate. Outdoor mobile robot
                  experiments show that place recognition measurements
                  significantly improve the estimate of the smoother in the
                  absence of GPS measurements.},

                  was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the
                  locations of objects while standing amid them and the layout
                  did not have salient intrinsic axes. It was also observed that
                  many participants retrieved spatial relations after
                  disorientation from the original learning heading. These
                  results indicate that people form an allocentric
                  representation of object-to-object spatial relations when they
                  learn the layout of a novel environment and use that
                  representation to locate objects around them. Egocentric
                  representations may be used to locate objects when allocentric
                  representations are not of high fidelity.},

                  estimating the 3D position and orientation (pose) of a moving
                  vehicle based on visual and inertial measurements. The main
                  advantage of the proposed method is that it provides precise
                  pose estimates at low computational cost. This is achieved by
                  introducing a two-layer estimation architecture that processes
                  measurements based on their information content. Inertial
                  measurements and feature tracks between consecutive images are
                  processed locally in the first layer (Multi-State-Constraint
                  Kalman filter) providing estimates for the motion of the
                  vehicle at a high rate. The second layer comprises a bundle
                  adjustment iterative estimator that operates intermittently so
                  as to (i) reduce the effect of the linearization errors, and
                  (ii) update the state estimates every time an area is
                  re-visited and features are re-detected (loop closure).
                  Through this process reliable state estimates are available
                  continuously, while the estimation errors remain bounded
                  during long-term operation. The performance of the developed
                  system is demonstrated in large-scale experiments, involving a

                  derivation of a measurement model that is able to express the

                  errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we

                  exteroceptive sensor measurement is processed for the
                  computation of two consecutive displacement estimates (both
                  forward and backward in time) these estimates are correlated,
                  and an analysis of the exact structure of the correlations is
                  performed. This analysis is utilized in the design of data
                  fusion algorithms, that correctly account for the existing
                  correlations. We examine two cases: i) pose propagation based

                  fusion of proprioceptive sensor information with

                  filter},
  abstract =     {In recent years, autonomous miniature airships have gained
                  increased interest in the robotics community. This is due to
                  their ability to move safely and hover for extended periods of
                  time. The major constraints of miniature airships come from
                  their limited payload which introduces substantial constraints
                  on their perceptional capabilities. In this paper, we consider
                  the problem of localizing a miniature blimp with lightweight
                  ultrasound sensors. Since the opening angle of the sound cone
                  emitted by a sonar sensor depends on the diameter of the
                  membrane, small-size sonar devices introduce the problem of
                  high uncertainty about which object has been perceived. We
                  present a novel sensor model for ultrasound sensors with large
                  opening angles that allows an autonomous blimp to robustly
                  localize itself in a known environment using Monte Carlo
                  localization. As we demonstrate in experiments with a real
                  blimp, our novel sensor model outperforms a popular sensor
                  model that has in the past been shown to work reliably on
                  wheeled platforms.},

  abstract =     {The emerging autonomous mobile robots promise a new level of
                  efficiency and flexibility. However, because these types of
                  systems operate in the same space as humans, mobile robots
                  must cope with dynamic changes and heterogeneously structured
                  environments. To ensure safety, new approaches are needed that
                  model risk at runtime. This risk depends on the situation and
                  is therefore a situational risk. In this paper, we propose a
                  new methodology to model situational risk based on multi-agent
                  adversarial reinforcement learning. In this methodology, two
                  competing groups of reinforcement learning agents, namely the
                  protagonists and the adversaries, fight against each other in
                  the simulation. The adversaries represent the disruptive and
                  destabilizing factors, while the protagonists try to
                  compensate for them. The situational risk is then derived from
                  the outcome of the simulated struggle. At this point, the
                  system’s Digital Twin provides up-to-date and relevant models
                  for simulation and synchronizes the simulation with the real
                  asset. Our risk modeling differentiates the four steps of
                  intelligent information processing: sense, analyze, process,
                  and execute. To find the appropriate adversaries and actors
                  for each of these steps, this methodology builds on Systems
                  Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Using STPA, we identify
                  critical signals that lead to losses when a disturbance under
                  certain conditions or in certain situations occurs. At this
                  point, the challenge of managing the complexity arises. We
                  face this issue using training effort as a metric to evaluate
                  it. Through statistical analysis of the identified signals, we
                  derive a procedure for defining action spaces and rewards for
                  the agents in question. We validate the methodology using the
                  example of a Robotino 3 Premium from Festo, an autonomous
                  mobile robot.},

  abstract =     {Rescue robotics has been suggested by a recent DARPA/NSF study
                  as an application domain for the research in human-robot
                  integration (HRI). This paper provides a short tutorial on how
                  robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR)
                  and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight
                  years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated.
                  The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model
                  identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in
                  robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a
                  general information flow model of how data from the robot is
                  fused by various team members into information and knowledge.
                  The information flow model also captures the types of
                  situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot
                  system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI
                  issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a
                  robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed
                  teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging
                  acceptance within the existing social structure.},

                  by a mobile robot equipped with both a video color camera and
                  a stereo-vision system. We focus on the interest of such a
                  multi-sensory system to deal with the navigation of a robot in
                  an a priori unknown environment, including (1) the incremental
                  construction of a landmark-based model, and the use of these
                  landmarks for (2) the 3-D localization of the mobile robot and
                  for (3) a sesnor-based navigation mode. For robot
                  localization, a slow process and a fast one are simultaneously
                  executed during the robot motions. In the Modeling process
                  (currently 0.1 Hz), the global landmark-based model is
                  incrementally built and the robot situation can be estimated
                  from discriminant landmarks selected amongst the detected
                  objects in the range data. In the tracking process (currently
                  4 Hz), selected landmarks are tracked in the visual data; the
                  tracking results are used to simplify the matching between
                  landmarks in the modeling process. Finally, a sensor-based
                  visual navigation mode, based on the same landmark selection
                  and tracking, is also presented; in order to navigate during a
                  long robot motion, different landmarks (targets) can be
                  selected as a sequence of sub-goals that the robot must

  volume =       19,
  abstract =     {In this paper, the problem of fully decentralized data fusion
                  and control for a modular wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is
                  addressed. This is a vehicle system with nonlinear kinematics,
                  distributed multiple sensors, and nonlinear sensor models. The
                  problem is solved by applying fully decentralized estimation
                  and control algorithms based on the extended information
                  filter. This is achieved by deriving a modular, decentralized
                  kinematic model by using plane motion kinematics to obtain the
                  forward and inverse kinematics for a generalized simple
                  wheeled vehicle. This model is then used in the decentralized
                  estimation and control algorithms. WMR estimation and control
                  is thus obtained locally using reduced order models with
                  reduced communication requirements, in a scalable network of
                  control nodes. If communication of information between nodes
                  is carried out after every measurement (full rate
                  communication), the estimates and control signals obtained at
                  each node are equivalent to those obtained by a corresponding
                  centralized system. Transputer architecture is used as the
                  basis for hardware and software design as it supports the
                  extensive communication and concurrency requirements that
                  characterize modular and decentralized systems. The advantages
                  of a modular WMR vehicle include scalability, application
                  flexibility, low prototyping costs, and high reliability.},

  abstract =     {Virtually all structured light methods in computer vision
                  assume that the scene and the sources are immersed in pure air
                  and that light is neither scattered nor absorbed. Recently,
                  however, structured lighting has found growing application in
                  underwater and aerial imaging, where scattering effects cannot
                  be ignored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
                  of two representative methods - light stripe range scanning
                  and photometric stereo - in the presence of scattering. For
                  both methods, we derive physical models for the appearances of
                  a surface immersed in a scattering medium. Based on these
                  models, we present results on (a) the condition for object
                  detectability in light striping and (b) the number of sources
                  required for photometric stereo. In both cases, we demonstrate
                  that while traditional methods fail when scattering is
                  significant, our methods accurately recover the scene (depths,
                  normals, albedos) as well as the properties of the medium.
                  These results are in turn used to restore the appearances of
                  scenes as if they were captured in clear air. Although we have
                  focused on light striping and photometric stereo, our approach
                  can also be extended to other methods such as grid coding,
                  gated and active polarization imaging.},

                  estimator for multi-robot Cooperative Localization (CL). As
                  opposed to centralized MAP-based CL, the proposed algorithm
                  reduces the memory and processing requirements by distributing
                  data and computations amongst the robots. Specifically, a
                  distributed data-allocation scheme is presented that enables
                  robots to simultaneously process and update their local data.
                  Additionally, a distributed Conjugate Gradient algorithm is
                  employed that reduces the cost of computing the MAP estimates,
                  while utilizing all available resources in the team and
                  increasing robustness to single-point failures. Finally, a

  abstract =     {This paper presents a closed form solution to the multiple
                  platform simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM)
                  problem. Closed form solutions are presented in both state
                  space and information based forms. A key conclusion of this
                  paper is that the information-state based form offers many
                  advantages over the state space formulation in allowing the
                  SLAM algorithm to be decentralised across multiple platforms.
                  The benefits of operating SLAM in an information form are
                  numerous. The additive properties of the information update
                  make it especially attractive, as does the ability to predict
                  estimates through any direction in time. However, of paramount
                  importance is the well-known ability to decentralise the
                  information filter. A general form of the continuous time
                  inverse covariance matrix for the SLAM problem is presented to
                  determine such properties as the initial and steady state
                  conditions. These properties are investigated to determine
                  their dependence and relationship to both the observation and
                  process noise. Examination of the structure of the general
                  form of the inverse covariance matrix also gives an insight
                  into what information should be communicated between platforms
                  in the decentralised architecture and how it can be managed.},

                  and mapping (SLAM) for teams of collaborating vehicles where

                  bandwidth limitations such as typically found in airborne
                  vehicle applications. The key idea is to represent maps in
                  information form (negative log-likelihood), and to selectively
                  communicate subsets of the information tailored to the

  abstract =     {Robotics applications have hard time constraints and heavy
                  computational burdens that can greatly benefit from
                  domain-specific hardware accelerators. For the
                  latency-critical problem of robot motion planning and control,
                  there exists a performance gap of at least an order of
                  magnitude between joint actuator response rates and
                  state-of-the-art software solutions. Hardware acceleration can
                  close this gap, but it is essential to define automated
                  hardware design flows to keep the design process agile as
                  applications and robot platforms evolve. To address this
                  challenge, we introduce robomorphic computing: a methodology
                  to transform robot morphology into a customized hardware
                  accelerator morphology. In this work, we (i) present this
                  design methodology, using robot topology and structure to
                  exploit parallelism and matrix sparsity patterns in
                  accelerator hardware; (ii) use the methodology to generate a
                  parameterized accelerator design for the gradient of rigid
                  body dynamics, a key kernel in motion planning; (iii) evaluate
                  FPGA and synthesized ASIC implementations of this accelerator
                  for an industrial manipulator robot; and (iv) describe how the
                  design can be automatically customized for other robot models.
                  Using robomorphic computing, our FPGA accelerator achieves
                  speedups of 8x and 86x over CPU and GPU latency, and maintains
                  an overall speedup from 1.9x to 2.9x deployed in an end-to-end
                  coprocessor system. ASIC synthesis indicates an additional
                  factor of 7.2x. We describe how this principled approach
                  generalizes to more complex robot platforms, such as
                  quadrupeds and humanoids, as well as to other computational
                  kernels in robotics, outlining a path forward for future
                  robomorphic computing accelerators.},

  abstract =     {This paper describes a 3D SLAM system using information from
                  an actuated laser scanner and camera installed on a mobile
                  robot. The laser samples the local geometry of the environment
                  and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the
                  workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to
                  detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal
                  estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based
                  retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to
                  repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic
                  measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are
                  then further processed with their corresponding local laser
                  scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations.
                  We show how naive application of this transformation to effect
                  the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors
                  and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing
                  errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system
                  working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing
                  substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals.
                  The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a
                  ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper
                  concludes with an extension into the multi-robot domain in
                  which 3D maps resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common
                  reference frame) are combined without recourse to mutual

                  epipolar geometry with applications to autonomous vehicle
                  navigation. Such uncertainty information is necessary for
                  making informed decisions regarding the confidence of a motion
                  estimate, since we must otherwise accept the estimate without
                  any knowledge of the probability that the estimate is in
                  error. For example, we may wish to fuse visual estimates with
                  information from GPS and inertial sensors, but without
                  uncertainty information, we have no principled way to do so.
                  Ideally, we would perform a full search over the 7-dimensional
                  space of fundamental matrices to yield an estimate and its
                  related uncertainty. However, searching this space is
                  computationally infeasible. As a compromise between fully
                  representing posterior likelihood over this space and
                  producing a single estimate, we represent the uncertainty over
                  the space of translation directions in a calibrated framework.
                  In contrast to finding a single estimate, representing the
                  posterior likelihood is always a well-posed problem, albeit an
                  often computationally challenging one. Given the posterior
                  likelihood, we derive a confidence interval around the motion
                  estimate. We verify the correctness of the confidence interval
                  using synthetic data and show examples of uncertainty
                  estimates using vehicle-mounted camera sequences.},

                  or a single moving camera based on video input. The system
                  operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates
                  are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the
                  system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched
                  between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at
                  video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then
                  produced from the feature tracks using a geometric
                  hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call
                  visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input
                  alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is
                  necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction
                  with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia
                  sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has
                  been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and
                  handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous

                  negotiating about different tasks. After the allocation each
                  of the robots gets it's subtask and develops it's own plan,
                  there is a problem in oreder not to get conflicting plans in
                  terms of accomplishing subtask and using resources. While each
                  robot executes it's plan the failure may occur and the the
                  planner is reinitiated. There is a lot of planning going on
                  which may be quite time consuming also robots are assigned
                  priorities in the allocation phase. Is a good idea?
                  Negotiation is going on only on the symbolic level and is to
                  certain extent recursive. For the cooperation, we may need
                  somthing on the sensory level. Pusher and Supervisor Example.

                  contribution relies on an adaptive color model of the tracked
                  object. This target distribution is implemented by color
                  histograms. This approach gives a significant increase of
                  robustness against non-rigidity, rotation and partial
                  occlusion. The paper compares the proposed approach with
                  {\textbackslash}emphmean shift, another tracking method which

                  surveillance systems. One dificult problem when using the
                  process is maintaining a correct background image against
                  changing illumination conditions. Most methods for maintaining
                  the background image are based on intuitive definitions about
                  the illumination change and are implemented as somewhat ad hoc
                  algorithms. In contrast, we first define mathematical models
                  representing the relation between the illumination intensity,
                  a rejection index of objects and a pixel value. We also
                  mathematically define an assumption about illumination, which
                  requires that the distribution of the illumination intensity
                  in a small region does not change Then we formalize the
                  background subtraction problem as a statistical test based on
                  the models and assunip tion. The experinients show that our
                  models appropriately express the imaging process of a camera
                  and our method' provides stable detection performance for
                  foreground objects.},

                  The work by Oliva and Torralba is based psychophysically on
                  the PhD work of Aude Oliva
                  {\textbackslash}citeoliva00{\textbackslash}citeschyns94. Even
                  when viewing scenes only for a very short time period, humans
                  are able to extract enough visual information to accurately
                  recognize its categorical properties. The authors thus use the
                  discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the windowed DFT in order
                  to describe and to learn the spatial properties of certain
                  scene categories. In {\textbackslash}citeoliva01, they learn
                  the degrees of naturalness, of openness, of roughness, of
                  expansion and of ruggedness (spatial envelope properties) in
                  order to sort unseen images along these axes. In
                  {\textbackslash}citetorralba01a, the DFT and the windowed DFT
                  are used to determine the global depth of a scene without
                  absolute depth measurements. In general, the goal of the
                  authors' work is to generate scene-centered descriptions from
                  the spatial envelope properties

  abstract =     {This paper explores and investigates deep convolutional neural
                  network architectures to increase the efficiency and
                  robustness of semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed
                  solutions are based on up-convolutional networks. We introduce
                  three different architectures in this work. The first
                  architecture, called Part-Net, is designed to tackle the
                  specific problem of human body part segmentation and to
                  provide robustness to overfitting and body part occlusion. The
                  second network, called Fast-Net, is a network specifically
                  designed to provide the smallest computation load without
                  losing representation power. Such an architecture is capable
                  of being run on mobile GPUs. The last architecture, called
                  M-Net, aims to maximize the robustness characteristics of deep
                  semantic segmentation approaches through multiresolution
                  fusion. The networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on
                  the PASCAL Parts dataset and competitive results on the KITTI
                  dataset for road and lane segmentation. Moreover, we introduce
                  a new part segmentation dataset, the Freiburg City dataset,
                  which is designed to bring semantic segmentation to highly
                  realistic robotics scenarios. Additionally, we present results
                  obtained with a ground robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle
                  and a full system to explore the capabilities of human body
                  part segmentation in the context of human–robot interaction.},

                  system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a
                  visual surveillance task. The system is particularly concerned
                  with detecting when interactions between people occur and
                  classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting
                  interaction behaviors include following another person,
                  altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system
                  combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed
                  feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical
                  Bayesian approach. We propose and compare two different
                  state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for
                  modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown
                  to work much more efficiently and accurately. Finally, to deal
                  with the problem of limited training data, a synthetic
                  Alife-style training system is used to develop flexible prior
                  models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the
                  ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify
                  real human behaviors and interactions with no additional
                  tuning or training.},

                  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms
                  attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot
                  trajectory. The constraints are generally non-linear, thus
                  SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear optimization problem. The
                  optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates
                  arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state
                  space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm
                  that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a
                  poor initial estimate. Our approach uses a variant of

                  properties.We compare our algorithm to several others, using

  abstract =     {Architectural legibility is the degree to which the designed
                  features of the environment aid people in creating an
                  effective mental image, or "cognitive map" of the spatial
                  relationships within a building, and the subsequent ease of
                  wayfinding within the environment. However, little research
                  has attempted to operationalize legibility by examining the
                  relationship between objective measures of the physical
                  environment, the cognitive map, and observational measures of
                  wayfinding performance. This article empirically assesses the
                  effects of one environmental variable, topological floor plan
                  complexity, on the cognitive mapping and wayfinding
                  performance of 63 participants within three building settings.
                  The study finds that this objective measure of floor plan
                  complexity significantly influences cognitive mapping and
                  observed wayfinding. Given these results, a conceptual model
                  of one aspect of architectural legibility was developed and
                  empirically tested. Path analysis was used to assess the
                  relationship between topological plan configuration, four
                  convergent measures of the cognitive map, and observational
                  measures of human wayfinding performance. Analysis of these
                  data provide support for the conceptual model. The model
                  suggests that the complexity of topological plan configuration
                  influences legibility. The evidence also indicates that the
                  relationship between plan configuration and wayfinding is
                  mediated by the accuracy of the cognitive map.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, the design of an office-guide robot for social
                  interaction studies is presented. We are interested in
                  studying the impact of passage behaviours in casual
                  encounters. While the system offers assistance in locating the
                  appropriate office that a visitor wants to reach, it is
                  expected to engage in a passing behaviour to allow free
                  passage for other persons that it may encounter. Through use
                  of such an approach it is possible to study the effect of
                  social interaction in a situation that is much more natural
                  than out-of-context user studies. The system has been tested
                  in an early evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7
                  hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were registered
                  and 13 passage behaviors were performed to conclude that this
                  framework can be successfully used for the evaluationof
                  passing behaviors in natural contexts of operation.},

                  distance of passage is a key parameter to consider. An
                  implemented system has been used in a small study to verify
                  the basic parametric design for such a system. In total 10
                  subjects evaluated variations in proxemics for encounters with
                  a robot in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates
                  that entering the intimate sphere of people is less
                  comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is also
                  considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of avoidance is a
                  behaviour that must be carefully tuned.},

  abstract =     {Background subtraction is a widely used paradigm to detect
                  moving objects in video taken from a static camera and is used
                  for various important applications such as video surveillance,
                  human motion analysis, etc. Various statistical approaches
                  have been proposed for modeling a given scene background.
                  However, there is no theoretical framework for choosing which
                  features to use to model different regions of the scene
                  background. In this paper we introduce a novel framework for
                  feature selection for background modeling and subtraction. A
                  boosting algorithm, namely RealBoost, is used to choose the
                  best combination of features at each pixel. Given the
                  probability estimates from a pool of features calculated by
                  Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) over a certain time period, the
                  algorithm selects the most useful ones to discriminate
                  foreground objects from the scene background. The results show
                  that the proposed framework successfully selects appropriate
                  features for different parts of the image.},

  abstract =     {Many inference problems that arise in sensor networks require
                  the computation of a global conclusion that is consistent with
                  local information known to each node. A large class of these
                  problems - including probabilistic inference, regression, and
                  control problems - can be solved by message passing on a data
                  structure called a junction tree. In this paper, we present a
                  distributed architecture for solving these problems that is
                  robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this
                  architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble
                  themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between
                  neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and
                  exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient
                  distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction
                  tree to minimize the communication and computation required by
                  inference. We present experimental results from a prototype
                  implementation on a 97-node Mica2 mote network, as well as
                  simulation results for three applications: distributed sensor
                  calibration, optimal control, and sensor field modeling. These
                  experiments demonstrate that our distributed architecture can
                  solve many important inference problems exactly, efficiently,
                  and robustly.},

  title =        {Robust {Probabilistic} {Inference} in {Distributed} {Systems}},
  abstract =     {Probabilistic inference problems arise naturally in
                  distributed systems such as sensor networks and teams of
                  mobile robots. Inference algorithms that use message passing
                  are a natural fit for distributed systems, but they must be
                  robust to the failure situations that arise in real-world
                  settings, such as unreliable communication and node failures.
                  Unfortunately, the popular sum-product algorithm can yield
                  very poor estimates in these settings because the nodes'
                  beliefs before convergence can be arbitrarily different from
                  the correct posteriors. In this paper, we present a new
                  message passing algorithm for probabilistic inference which
                  provides several crucial guarantees that the standard
                  sum-product algorithm does not. Not only does it converge to
                  the correct posteriors, but it is also guaranteed to yield a
                  principled approximation at any point before convergence. In
                  addition, the computational complexity of the message passing
                  updates depends only upon the model, and is independent of the
                  network topology of the distributed system. We demonstrate the
                  approach with detailed experimental results on a distributed
                  sensor calibration task using data from an actual sensor
                  network deployment.},

  title =        {{6DOF} {SLAM} with {Stereo}-in-hand},
  abstract =     {In this paper we describe a system that carries out SLAM using
                  a stereo pair moving with 6DOF as the only sensor. Textured
                  point features are extracted from the images and stored as 3D
                  points if seen in both images with sufficient disparity, or
                  stored as inverse 3D points otherwise. This allows the system
                  to make use of both near and far features that provide
                  distance and orientation, or orientation information,
                  respectively. Unlike other vision only SLAM systems, stereo
                  does not suffer from ?cale drift?because of unobservability
                  problems, and thus no other information such as gyroscopes or
                  accelerometers is required. Our SLAM algorithm generates
                  sequences of conditionally independent local maps that can
                  share information related to the camera motion and common
                  features being tracked. The system computes the full map using
                  the Divide and Conquer algorithm adapted for conditionally
                  independent local maps, allowing linear time execution. We
                  show experimental results in outdoor urban environments that
                  demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our system.},

  abstract =     {Recent successful SLAM methods employ hybrid map
                  representations combining the strengths of topological maps
                  and occupancy grids. Such representations often facilitate
                  multi-agent mapping. In this paper, a successful SLAM method
                  is presented, which is inspired by the manifold data structure
                  by Howard et al. This method maintains a graph with sensor
                  observations stored in vertices and pose differences including
                  uncertainty information stored in edges. Through its graph
                  structure, updates are local and can be efficiently
                  communicated to peers. The graph links represent known
                  traversable space, and facilitate tasks like path planning. We
                  demonstrate that our SLAM method produces very detailed maps
                  without sacrificing scalability. The presented method was used
                  by the UvA Rescue Virtual Robots team, which won the Best
                  Mapping Award in the RoboCup Rescue Virtual Robots competition

                  the system to achieve reliable background modeling. In
                  addition, histogram-based compulation and the new concept of
                  local basins of attraction allow us to meet the stringent

  abstract =     {Robotic underwater vehicles are regularly performing vast
                  optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists value these
                  surveys since optical images offer high levels of detail and
                  are easily interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, the coverage
                  of a single image is limited by absorption and backscatter
                  while what is generally desired is an overall view of the
                  survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics assume planar
                  scenes and are applicable only to situations without much
                  relief. We present a complete and validated system for
                  processing optical images acquired from an underwater robotic
                  vehicle to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our
                  approach is designed for the most general conditions of
                  wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence of significant
                  3D structure) and scales to hundreds or thousands of images.
                  We only assume a calibrated camera system and a vehicle with
                  uncertain and possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a
                  compass, depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our
                  approach is based on a combination of techniques from computer
                  vision, photogrammetry, and robotics. We use a local to global
                  approach to structure from motion, aided by the navigation
                  sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D sub-maps. These sub-maps
                  are then placed in a common reference frame that is refined by
                  matching overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing
                  is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D structure, camera
                  poses, and uncertainty estimates in a consistent reference
                  frame. We present results with ground truth for structure as
                  well as results from an oceanographic survey over a coral
                  reef.},

  abstract =     {The visual recognition of three-dimensional (3-D) objects on
                  the basis of their shape poses at least two difficult
                  problems. First, there is the problem of variable
                  illumination, which can be addressed by working with
                  relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than
                  the raw intensity images. Second, there is the problem of the
                  initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer.
                  In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made
                  about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object
                  from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual
                  image. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of
                  objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a
                  difficult problem. To address this problem in computational
                  vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of
                  approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a
                  small set of perspective views a function mapping any
                  viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this
                  scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was
                  trained from any viewpoint.},

  abstract =     {We present a novel algorithm to detect and remove cast shadows
                  in a video sequence by taking advantage of the statistical
                  prevalence of the shadowed regions over the object regions. We
                  model shadows using multivariate Gaussians. We apply a weak
                  classifier as a prefilter. We project shadow models into a
                  quantized color space to update a shadow flow function. We use
                  shadow flow, background models, and current frame to determine
                  the shadow and object regions. This method has several
                  advantages: It does not require a color space transformation.
                  We pose the problem in the RGB color space, and we can carry
                  out the same analysis in other Cartesian spaces as well. It is
                  data-driven and adapts to the changing shadow conditions. In
                  other words, accuracy of our method is not limited by the
                  preset values. Furthermore, it does not assume any 3D models
                  for the target objects or tracking of the cast shadows between
                  frames. Our results show that the detection performance is

                  viewing perspectives is an important requirement for many
                  computer vision applications. One of the key factors in
                  enhancing the robustness of dynamic scene analysis is that of
                  accurate and reliable means for shadow detection. Shadow
                  detection is critical for correct object detection in image
                  sequences. Many algorithms have been proposed in the
                  literature that deal with shadows. However, a comparative

                  this paper, the full range of problems underlying the shadow
                  detection are identified and discussed. We classify the
                  proposed solutions to this problem using a taxonomy of four
                  main classes, called deterministic model and non-model based

                  detection is critical for accurate object detection in video
                  streams since shadow points are often misclassified as object

  title =        {Wide baseline stereo matching},
  abstract =     {The objective of this work is to enlarge the class of camera
                  motions for which epipolar geometry and image correspondences
                  can be computed automatically. This facilitates matching
                  between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two
                  extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms:
                  first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is
                  developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods
                  over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating
                  putative corner matches between image pairs using local
                  homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also
                  described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and
                  the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior
                  to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is
                  demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative
                  motion, and for different scene types. All processing is
                  automatic},

                  investigated extensively for performing inference over the
                  space of metric maps, no corresponding general purpose methods
                  exist for topological maps. We present the concept of
                  Probabilistic Topological Maps (PTMs), a sample-based
                  representation that approximates the posterior distribution
                  over topologies given available sensor measurements. We show
                  that the space of topologies is equivalent to the intractably
                  large space of set partitions on the set of available
                  measurements. The combinatorial nature of the problem is
                  overcome by computing an approximate, sample-based
                  representation of the posterior. The PTM is obtained by
                  performing Bayesian inference over the space of all possible

                  of perceptual aliasing in the domain of topological mapping.
                  In this paper, we describe a general framework for modeling

                  Mapping (SLAM) problem in robotics are superior to the more
                  common filtering approaches in being exact, better equipped to
                  deal with non-linearities, and computing the entire robot
                  trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that perform
                  map updates in constant time exist, no analogous smoothing
                  method is available. We aim to rectify this situation by
                  presenting a smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy
                  Belief Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory and
                  map updates in constant time except when a loop is closed in
                  the environment. The SLAM problem is represented as a Gaussian
                  Markov Random Field (GMRF) over which LBP is performed. We
                  prove that LBP, in this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel
                  relaxation of a linear system. The inability to compute
                  marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing algorithm has
                  previously been a stumbling block to their widespread use. LBP
                  enables the efficient recovery of the marginal covariances,
                  albeit approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the final
                  covariances are overconfident, the ones obtained from a
                  spanning tree of the GMRF are conservative, making them useful

                  decentralized multi-sensor systems. Decentralized
                  architectures have many benefits in terms of modularity, speed
                  and robustness. The state estimation (tracking) algorithm is a
                  decentralized Kalman filter (DKF) based on the extended Kalman
                  filter. Identification is achieved by the decentralized
                  Bayesian identification (DBI) algorithm, which identifies
                  targets being tracked. For each of the algorithms The authors
                  discuss optimality and the effect of reducing connectivity.
                  The structure of the algorithms leads to the development of an
                  architecture for a modular sensing node based on communication
                  considerations. The authors present example implementations of
                  both algorithms on actual transputer-based sensing nodes. They

                  Kalman filter algorithm amongst the sensing nodes of a
                  multisensor system is preserved. This algorithm does not
                  require any form of central processing facility or centralised
                  communications medium. Each sensing node implements its own
                  local Kalman filter to arrive at a partial decision which it
                  then broadcasts to every other node. Each node then
                  assimilates this received information to arrive at its own
                  local estimate of the system state. The algorithm guarantees
                  that each local estimate thus obtained is identical to the
                  estimate that would be obtained if a conventional, completely
                  centralised, Kalman filter were used. Because there is no
                  single central processing node the algorithm is highly
                  resilient to loss of one or more sensing nodes. The fully

  abstract =     {This paper presents a new sensing modality and stratagem for
                  multirobot exploration. The approach is based on using pairs
                  of robots that observe each other's behavior, acting in
                  concert to reduce odometry errors. We assume the robots can
                  both directly sense nearby obstacles and see each other. This
                  allows the robots to obtain a map of higher accuracy than
                  would be possible with robots acting independently by reducing
                  inaccuracies that occur over time from dead reckoning errors.
                  Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of the robots to see
                  each other, we can detect opaque obstacles in the environment
                  independently of their surface reflectance properties. Two
                  different algorithms, based on the size of the environment,
                  are introduced with a complexity analysis, and experimental
                  results in simulation and with real robots},

  volume =       39,
  abstract =     {LAMA is a classical planning system based on heuristic forward
                  search. Its core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic
                  derived from landmarks, propositional formulas that must be
                  true in every solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the
                  Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather than
                  binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter
                  is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant
                  of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are
                  cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case
                  where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search is
                  used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner
                  continues to search for plans of better quality until the
                  search is terminated. {\textbackslash} LAMA showed best
                  performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing
                  track of the International Planning Competition 2008. In this
                  paper we present the system in detail and investigate which
                  features of LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present
                  individual results for some of the domains used at the
                  competition, demonstrating good and bad cases for the
                  techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using
                  landmarks improves performance, whereas the incorporation of
                  action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be
                  beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores
                  cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to
                  deal with action costs more effectively in the future. The
                  iterated weighted A* search greatly improves results, and
                  shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.},

                  largely overlapping clusters of activiation loci in an

                  of a decentralised air and ground sensing network for target
                  tracking and identification. The theoretical methods employed
                  for studying decentralised data fusion problems are based on
                  the information-filter formulation of the Kalman filter
                  algorithm and on information-theoretic methods derived from
                  the Bayes theorem. The paper particularly focuses on how these
                  methods are applied in very large heterogeneous sensor
                  networks, where there may be a significant amount of data
                  delay or corruption in communication. This paper then
                  describes the development of a practical system aimed at
                  demonstrating some of these principles. The system consists of
                  a number of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), with radar and
                  vision payloads, able to observe a number of ground targets.
                  The UAV sensor payloads are constructed in a modular fashion,
                  with the ability to communicate in a network with both other
                  air-borne and other ground sensors. The ground sensor system
                  comprises of multiple modular sensing nodes which include
                  vision scanned laser, steerable radar, multiple fixed radar
                  arrays, and combined night vision (IR)-radar.},

                  prime of importance in interactive robot programming, sensor
                  technology for tracking the user's actions and behavior is
                  attached more and more importance. However, traditional
                  methods based on single sensor system input are already at
                  their limits, since PbD is an application area where real-time
                  requirement do play an important role. Thus, a sensor fusion
                  approach is proposed which serves input data for a finite
                  state automat. The input sources are on the one hand a
                  data-glove which classifies different grips and on the other
                  hand a movable camera head which tracks the movements of the
                  data glove as well as estimates object positions. Both sensor
                  sources use time efficient algorithms, since sensory data must
                  be processed in real-time. The efficiency of this approach is
                  proven in a PbD environment were flexible infusion bags are
                  handled and respective actions and object positions are
                  recognized.},

                  related to performing Gaussian elimination on sparse symmetric
                  and unsymmetrlc systems of linear equations. We discuss good
                  algorithms for finding elimination orderings, showing that a
                  generalization of breadth-first search, called lexicographlc
                  search, can be used to find perfect orderlngs in O(n+e) time
                  and minimal orderlngs in O(ne) time, if the problem graph is
                  undirected and has n vertices and e edges. We also give
                  efficient (though slower) algorithms for generating such

  abstract =     {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the process of
                  constructing a global model of an environment from local
                  observations of it; this is a foundational capability for
                  mobile robots, supporting such core functions as planning,
                  navigation, and control. This article reviews recent progress
                  in SLAM, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of
                  the environmental models used in SLAM systems (representation)
                  and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these
                  models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent SLAM
                  research is the pursuit of environmental representations
                  (including learned representations) that go beyond the
                  classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model
                  properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance,
                  dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous
                  agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world,
                  enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second
                  major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical
                  properties of the SLAM estimation problem itself (including
                  its computational and information-theoretic performance
                  limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes
                  of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically
                  improve the reliability of SLAM systems in real-world
                  operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their
                  ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy,
                  and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a

  abstract =     {Many online inference problems in computer vision and robotics
                  are characterized by probability distributions whose factor
                  graph representations are sparse and whose factors are all
                  Gaussian functions of error residuals. Under these conditions,
                  maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to solving a
                  sequence of sparse least-squares minimization problems in
                  which additional summands are added to the objective function
                  over time. In this paper we present Robust Incremental
                  least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of
                  the Powell's Dog-Leg trust-region method suitable for use in
                  online sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region
                  method, Powell's Dog-Leg enjoys excellent global convergence
                  properties, and is known to be considerably faster than both
                  Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt when applied to sparse
                  least-squares problems. Consequently, RISE maintains the speed
                  of current state-of-the-art incremental sparse least-squares
                  methods while providing superior robustness to objective
                  function nonlinearities.},

                  architectures impose severe scaling limitations for
                  distributed systems due to the enormous communication
                  overheads. We propose a strictly decentralized approach in

                  through an interactive communication protocol aimed at
                  maximizing information flow. Our approach is evaluated in the
                  context of a distributed surveillance scenario that arises in
                  a robotic system for playing the game of laser tag. Our

  abstract =     {We show that nonserial dynamic programming is optimal among
                  one class of algorithms for an important class of discrete
                  optimization problems. We consider discrete, multivariate,
                  optimization problems in which the objective function is given
                  as a sum of terms. Each term is a function of only a subset of
                  the variables. We first consider a class of optimization
                  algorithms which eliminate suboptimal solutions by comparing
                  the objective function on "comparable" partial solutions. A
                  large, natural subclass of comparison algorithms in which the
                  subproblems considered are either nested or nonadjacent (i.e.,
                  noninteracting) is then defined. It is shown that a
                  variable-elimination procedure, nonserial dynamic programming,
                  is optimal in an extremely strong sense among all algorithms
                  in the subclass. The results' strong implications for choosing
                  deterministic, adaptive, and nondeterministic algorithms for
                  the optimization problem, for defining a complexity measure
                  for a pattern of interactions, and for describing general
                  classes of decomposition procedures are discussed. Several
                  possible extensions and unsolved problems are mentioned.},

  abstract =     {The deployment of human gaze has been almost exclusively
                  studied independent of any specific ongoing task and limited
                  to two-dimensional picture viewing. This contrasts with its
                  use in everyday life, which mostly consists of purposeful
                  tasks where gaze is crucially involved. To better understand
                  deployment of gaze under such circumstances, we devised a
                  series of experiments, in which subjects navigated along a
                  walkway in a virtual environment and executed combinations of
                  approach and avoidance tasks. The position of the body and the
                  gaze were monitored during the execution of the task
                  combinations and dependence of gaze on the ongoing tasks as
                  well as the visual features of the scene was analyzed. Gaze
                  distributions were compared to a random gaze allocation
                  strategy as well as a specific ?aliency model.?Gaze
                  distributions showed high similarity across subjects.
                  Moreover, the precise fixation locations on the objects
                  depended on the ongoing task to the point that the specific
                  tasks could be predicted from the subject? fixation data. By
                  contrast, gaze allocation according to a random or a saliency
                  model did not predict the executed fixations or the observed
                  dependence of fixation locations on the specific task.},

  abstract =     {We present a new approach to the problem of simultaneously
                  localizing a group of mobile robots capable of sensing each
                  other. Each of the robots collects sensor data regarding its
                  own motion and shares this information with the rest of the
                  team during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the form
                  of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning
                  information from all the members of the team and produces a
                  pose estimate for each of them. The equations for this
                  centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form
                  thus allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into
                  a number of smaller communicating filters, each of them
                  processing local data for most of the time. The resulting
                  decentralized estimation scheme constitutes a unique mean for
                  fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with
                  minimal communication and processing requirements. The
                  distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of 3
                  robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is
                  presented. Finally, a comparison to the equivalent distributed

                  solve the SLAM problem using stereo vision. This approach
                  results for an improvement, in terms of both efficiency and
                  robustness, of our early multi-view ICP randomized algorithm.
                  Instead of minimizing an ICP-based cost, we propose the
                  minimization of the entropy of the 2D distribution induced by
                  the projection of the 3D point cloud. In addition we embed
                  both the egomotion/action estimation algorithm which precedes
                  global rectification and the new global rectification
                  algorithm in an autonomous exploration schema. We assume
                  plane-parallel environments and, for the sake of efficiency,
                  we also assume a flat floor and a fixed stereo camera mounted
                  on the robot. We show successful experiments both under
                  tele-operating the robot and under autonomous navigation.},

  abstract =     {Recent work in the object recognition community has yielded a
                  class of interest-point-based features that are stable under
                  significant changes in scale, viewpoint, and illumination,
                  making them ideally suited to landmark-based navigation.
                  Although many such features may be visible in a given view of
                  the robot? environment, only a few such features are necessary
                  to estimate the robot? position and orientation. In this
                  paper, we address the problem of automatically selecting, from
                  the entire set of features visible in the robot? environment,
                  the minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can navigate its
                  environment. Specifically, we decompose the world into a small
                  number of maximally sized regions, such that at each position
                  in a given region, the same small set of features is visible.
                  We introduce a novel graph theoretic formulation of the
                  problem, and prove that it is NP-complete. Next, we introduce
                  a number of approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the decompositions
                  from the real image data to measure the localization
                  performance versus the undecomposed map.},

  volume =       95,
  abstract =     {Shadows are integral parts of natural scenes and one of the
                  elements contributing to nat- uralness of synthetic scenes. In
                  many image analysis and interpretation applications, shadows
                  interfere with fundamental tasks such as object extraction and
                  description. For this reason, shadow segmentation is an
                  important step in image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
                  new cast shadow segmentation algorithm for both still and
                  moving images. The proposed technique exploits spectral and
                  geometrical properties of shadows in a scene to perform this
                  task. The presence of a shadow is first hypothesized with an
                  initial and simple evidence based on the fact that shadows
                  darken the surface which they are cast upon. The validity of
                  detected regions as shadows is further verified by making use
                  of more complex hypotheses on color invariance and geometric
                  properties of shadows. Finally, an information integration
                  stage confirms or rejects the initial hypothesis for every
                  detected region. Simulation results show that the proposed
                  algorithm is robust and efficient in detecting shadows for a
                  large class of scenes.},

  abstract =     {Since 2014, a specific standard has been dedicated for the
                  safety certification of personal care robots, which operate in
                  close proximity to humans. These robots serve as information
                  providers, object transporters, personal mobility carriers,
                  and security patrollers. In this article, we point out the
                  shortcomings concerning EN ISO 13482:2014, which encompasses
                  guidelines regarding the safety and design of personal care
                  robots. In particular, we argue that the current standard is
                  not suitable for guaranteeing people's safety when these
                  robots operate in public spaces. Specifically, the standard
                  lacks requirements to protect pedestrians and bystanders. The
                  guideline implicitly assumes that private spaces, such as
                  households and offices, present the same hazards as in public
                  spaces. We highlight the existence of at least three
                  properties pertaining to robots’ use in public spaces. These
                  properties include (1) crowds, (2) social norms and proxemics
                  rules, and (3) people's misbehaviours. We discuss how these
                  properties impact robots’ safety. This article aims to raise
                  stakeholders’ awareness on individuals’ safety when robots are
                  deployed in public spaces. This could be achieved by
                  integrating the gaps present in EN ISO 13482:2014 or by
                  creating a new dedicated standard.},

  title =        {Automatic line matching across views},
  abstract =     {The paper presents a new method for matching individual line
                  segments between images. The method uses both grey-level
                  information and the multiple view geometric relations between
                  the images. For image pairs epipolar geometry facilitates the
                  computation of a cross-correlation based matching score for
                  putative line correspondences. For image triplets
                  cross-correlation matching scores are used in conjunction with
                  line transfer based on the trifocal geometry. Algorithms are
                  developed for both short and long range motion. In the case of
                  long range motion the algorithm involves evaluating a one
                  parameter family of plane induced homographies. The algorithms
                  are robust to deficiencies in the line segment extraction and
                  partial occlusion. Experimental results are given for image
                  pairs and triplets, for varying motions between views, and for
                  different scene types. The three view algorithm eliminates all
                  mismatches},

                  sophisticated perceptual mechanisms that enable the robot to
                  recognize the objects that are to be stored in the robot map.
                  This paper investigates a particular object recognition
                  problem: the automatic detection and classification of
                  gateways in office environments based on laser range data. We
                  will propose, discuss, and empirically evaluate a sensor model
                  for crossing gateways and different approaches to gateway
                  classification including simple maximum classifiers and
                  HMM-based classification of observation sequences.},

                  with backward correction produces a consistent global 3D map.

  abstract =     {We have previously developed a mobile robot system which uses
                  scale-invariant visual landmarks to localize and
                  simultaneously build three-dimensional (3-D) maps of
                  unmodified environments. In this paper, we examine global
                  localization, where the robot localizes itself globally,
                  without any prior location estimate. This is achieved by
                  matching distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to
                  a database map. A Hough transform approach and a RANSAC
                  approach for global localization are compared, showing that
                  RANSAC is much more efficient for matching specific features,
                  but much worse for matching nonspecific features. Moreover,
                  robust global localization can be achieved by matching a small
                  submap of the local region built from multiple frames. This
                  submap alignment algorithm for global localization can be
                  applied to map building, which can be regarded as alignment of
                  multiple 3-D submaps. A global minimization procedure is
                  carried out using the loop closure constraint to avoid the
                  effects of slippage and drift accumulation. Landmark
                  uncertainty is taken into account in the submap alignment and
                  the global minimization process. Experiments show that global
                  localization can be achieved accurately using the
                  scale-invariant landmarks. Our approach of pairwise submap
                  alignment with backward correction in a consistent manner
                  produces a better global 3-D map.},

                  detecting foreground objects in dynamic scenes involving
                  swaying trees and fluttering flags. Most methods proposed so
                  far adjust the permissible range of the background image
                  variations according to the training samples of background
                  images. Thus, the detection sensitivity decreases at those
                  pixels having wide permissible ranges. If we can narrow the
                  ranges by analyzing input images, the detection sensitivity
                  can be improved. For this narrowing, we employ the property
                  that image variations at neighboring image blocks have strong
                  correlation, also known as cooccurrence. This approach is
                  essentially different from chronological background image
                  updating or morphological postprocessing. Experimental results
                  for real images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

                  factorization. It is not essential that this factorization be
                  interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities. The account

                  generalization of iterative closest point (ICP) registration
                  of range images. Pointwise correspondences are chosen as the
                  closest point with respect to a weighted linear combination of
                  positional and feature distances. It is shown that, under
                  ideal noise-free conditions, correspondences formed using this
                  distance function are correct more often than correspondences
                  formed using the positional distance alone. In addition,
                  monotonic convergence to at least a local minimum is shown to
                  hold for this method. When noise is present, a method that
                  automatically sets the optimal relative contribution of
                  features and positions is described. This method trades off
                  the error in feature values due to noise against the error in
                  positions due to misalignment. Experimental results suggest
                  that using invariant features decreases the probability of

                  decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling
                  dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for
                  representing the topology of environments such as road

                  such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate
                  better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being
                  robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results,

                  using Bayesian networks. In contrast to classical cue fusion
                  approaches using a voting approach, continuous Bayesian
                  modality fusion (CBMF) combines multiple cues by reasoning
                  about the individual cue's reliability. Continuous global
                  evidence-based Bayesian modality fusion has four main
                  advantages: 1) Continuous sampling reflects the complexity of
                  Bayesian inference most appropriately. 2) Using global
                  evidence allows to consider all observations from a single
                  modality for inference. Most voting approaches take only a
                  single observation per modality into consideration. 3)
                  Bayesian inference allows to introduce new evidence one by
                  one. This provides the ability to distinguish between
                  mandatory modalities required for object tracking and optional
                  modalities which give only further hints about the presence of
                  an object. Furthermore, the nature of Bayesian modality fusion
                  allows to implement on-demand computation for computationally
                  expensive modalities that are only computet selectively for
                  disambiguating ambigous object localization.}

                  approach uses particle filtering with an exclusion principle

                  the continuity assumption with Bayesian reasoning about
                  body-part associations based on contextual knowledge. After
                  localizing the subject's head with a mean shift tracker, a
                  Bayesian network s used for reasoning about the most probable
                  association of skin color blobs and hands. Due to this
                  reasoning, the system is able to deal reliably with fast,
                  discontinuous movements of the subject's hands.}

  abstract =     {The highly task-specific fixation patterns revealed in
                  performance of natural tasks demonstrate the fundamentally
                  active nature of vision, and suggest that in many situations,
                  top-down processes may be a major factor in the acquisition of
                  visual information. Understanding how a top-down visual system
                  could function requires understanding the mechanisms that
                  control the initiation of the different task-specific
                  computations at the appropriate time. This is particularly
                  difficult in dynamic environments, like driving, where many
                  aspects of the visual input may be unpredictable. We therefore
                  examined drivers?ability to detect Stop signs in a virtual
                  environment when the signs were visible for restricted periods
                  of time. Detection performance is heavily modulated both by
                  the instructions and the local visual context. This suggests
                  that visibility of the signs requires active search, and that
                  the frequency of this search is influenced by learnt knowledge
                  of the probabilistic structure of the environment.},

                  reference frames in the retrieval of survey knowledge learned
                  from either studying a map or navigating an environment. In
                  Experiment 1, performance was generally consistent with the
                  hypothesis that map knowledge is retrieved using a frame of
                  reference centered on the eye, characterized by (a) a fixed

                  access to spatial relations both in front of, or above, and
                  behind, or below, a right-left retrieval axis. The results of

                  centered on the body, characterized by (a) flexible

                  DeLange, \& M. D. Hazelrigg, 1989; C. C. Presson \& M. D.
                  Hazelrigg, 1984), others suggest that an orientation-specific
                  representation is formed (J. J. Rieser, 1989). Five
                  experiments are reported that together with existing studies,

                  viewing angle during encoding, a room-sized test space, and
                  "on-path" testing. If any one of these conditions was not
                  satisfied, orientation-specific performance was observed at
                  test. The findings support a multiple-view model of

                  conversational collaborative interactions with engagement
                  gestures. Finally the paper reports on findings of experiments
                  with human participants who interacted with a robot when it
                  performed or did not perform engagement gestures. Attention is
                  more frequenlty directed at the robot when it uses engagement

                  automatic mapping system that operates without the use of
                  active ranger sensors (such as laser or sonic transducers),
                  can operate in real-time and can consistently produce accurate

                  simultaneous localization and mapping problem and uses
                  efficient data structures for real-time data association,

                  occupancy grids for safe navigation. This paper describes our

                  distribution of a set of images. That is, given a sequence of
                  images acquired from well-separated locations, how can they be
                  arranged to best explain their genesis? The solution to this
                  problem can be viewed as an instance of robot mapping although
                  it can also be used in other contexts. We examine the problem
                  where only limited prior odometric information is available,
                  employing a feature-based method derived from a probabilistic
                  pose estimation framework. Initially, a set of visual features
                  is selected from the images and correspondences are found
                  across the ensemble. The images are then localized by first
                  assembling the small subset of images for which odometric
                  confidence is high, and sequentially inserting the remaining
                  images, localizing each against the previous estimates, and
                  taking advantage of any priors that are available. We present

                  demonstrating metrically and topologically accurate results

                  applications is commonplace when a prior map is available, but
                  building the map while tracking in real-time is much more

                  of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene

                  between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation
                  and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along
                  with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system

                  for use in experiments investigating differences and
                  similarities in the processing of pictures and words. The
                  pictures are black-and-white line drawings executed according
                  to a set of rules that provide consistency of pictorial
                  representation. The pictures have been standardized on four
                  variables of central relevance to memory and cognitive
                  processing: name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, and
                  visual complexity. The intercorrelations among the four
                  measures were low, suggesting that they are indices of
                  different attributes of the pictures. The concepts were
                  selected to provide exemplars from several widely studied
                  semantic categories. Sources of naming variance, and mean
                  familiarity and complexity of the exemplars, differed
                  significantly across the set of categories investigated. The
                  potential significance of each of the normative variables to a
                  number of semantic and episodic memory tasks is discussed.}

  abstract =     {Visual SLAM is, in recent years, a very active research area,
                  the result of activities in the convergence of the robotics
                  and computer vision communities. We present an overview of
                  techniques, from classical filtering to bundle adjustment
                  solutions, for both monocular and stereo (or multicamera)
                  systems, and emphasize that classical SLAM solutions have been
                  discarding precious sensory information. In particular, the
                  ability of vision to sense objects at infinity should be
                  exploited at its maximum because it is precisely these remote
                  objects that will provide long-term, stable angular references
                  (in the way a compass would do). Monocular SLAM systems have
                  already solved this issue, but stereo and multicamera systems
                  have not. We propose in these cases to use monocular SLAM
                  algorithms using fusion to incorporate all the information.
                  Numerous advantages like desynchronization of the sensors
                  firing, the possibility of using several unequal cameras, or
                  selfcalibration, will naturally arise. We develop a particular
                  method for extrinsically decalibrated stereo systems to
                  illustrate the proposed ideas. We evaluate the method with a
                  real indoor experiment, and highlight and discuss both its
                  assets and drawbacks.},

  abstract =     {Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest that
                  there is a tight link between eye movements and goal directed
                  motor actions. However, most existing models of human eye
                  movements provide a bottom up account that relates visual
                  attention to attributes of the visual scene. The purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a new model of human eye movements
                  that directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands of
                  behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements serve to reduce
                  uncertainty about environmental variables that are task
                  relevant. A value is assigned to an eye movement by estimating
                  the expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if the
                  movement is not made. If there are several candidate eye
                  movements, the one with the highest expected value is chosen.
                  The model is illustrated using a humanoid graphic figure that
                  navigates on a sidewalk in a virtual urban environment.
                  Simulations show our protocol is superior to a simple round

  abstract =     {The photorealistic modeling of large-scale scenes, such as
                  urban structures, requires a fusion of range sensing
                  technology and traditional digital photography. This paper
                  presents a system that integrates automated 3D-to-3D and
                  2D-to-3D registration techniques, with multiview geometry for
                  the photorealistic modeling of urban scenes. The 3D range
                  scans are registered using our automated 3D-to-3D registration
                  method that matches 3D features (linear or circular) in the
                  range images. A subset of the 2D photographs are then aligned
                  with the 3D model using our automated 2D-to-3D registration
                  algorithm that matches linear features between the range scans
                  and the photographs. Finally, the 2D photographs are used to
                  generate a second 3D model of the scene that consists of a
                  sparse 3D point cloud, produced by applying a multiview
                  geometry (structure-from-motion) algorithm directly on a
                  sequence of 2D photographs. The last part of this paper
                  introduces a novel algorithm for automatically recovering the
                  rotation, scale, and translation that best aligns the dense
                  and sparse models. This alignment is necessary to enable the
                  photographs to be optimally texture mapped onto the dense
                  model. The contribution of this work is that it merges the
                  benefits of multiview geometry with automated registration of
                  3D range scans to produce photorealistic models with minimal
                  human interaction. We present results from experiments in
                  large-scale urban scenes.},

  abstract =     {Humanoid robotics and SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and
                  Mapping) are certainly two of the most significant themes of
                  the current worldwide robotics research effort, bu tthe two
                  fields have up until now largely run independent parallel
                  paths, despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining the
                  two. The next major step forward in humanoid robotics will be
                  increased autonomy, and the ability of a robot to create its
                  own world map on the fly will be a significant enabling
                  technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found most success
                  with robot platforms and sensor configurations which are
                  outside of the humanoid domain. Humanoid robots move with high
                  linear and angular accelarations in full 3D, and normally only
                  vision is available as an outward-looking sensor. Building on
                  recently published work on monocular SLAM using vision, and on
                  pattern generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a humanoid
                  can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we present results in
                  which a sparse 3D map of visual landmarks is acquired on the
                  fly using a single camera and deonstrated loop closing and
                  drift-free 3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered
                  indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly coupling the
                  pattern generator, the robot odometry and inertial sensing to
                  aid visual mapping within a standard EKF framework. To our
                  knowledge this is the first implementation of real-time 3D
                  SLAM for a humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing.},

                  in image sequences involves back- ground subtraction, or
                  thresholding the error between an estimate of the image
                  without moving objects and the current image. The numerous
                  approaches to this problem differ in the type of background
                  model used and the procedure used to update the model. This
                  paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians
                  and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The
                  Gaussian distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
                  evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a
                  background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether
                  the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively
                  is considered part of the background model. This results in a
                  stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with

  abstract =     {The objective of the autonomous navigation and sensing
                  experiment research (ANSER) project is to demonstrate
                  decentralized data fusion (DDF) and simultaneous localization
                  and map building (SLAM) across multiple uninhabited air
                  vehicles (UAVs). To achieve this objective, the project
                  specifies the development of four UAVs, where each UAV houses
                  up to two terrain sensors and an INS/GPS navigation system.
                  The terrain sensors include a scanning radar, laser/vision and
                  standard vision system. The DDF concept has to be shown to be
                  effective both on a single UAV and on multiple UAVs. The proof
                  of the concept will lie in the ability of the DDF structure to
                  conduct multi-target tracking problems as well as SLAM. To
                  obtain this goal, a number of subgoals are required, most of
                  which have never been attempted before on a research level.
                  The objective of this paper is to present these goals as an
                  overview of the ANSER project along with some simulated and
                  real-time results.},

  abstract =     {We consider the problem of determining the optimal composition
                  of a heterogeneous multi-agent team for coverage problems by
                  including costs associated with different agents and subject
                  to an upper bound on the maximal allowable number of agents.
                  We formulate a resource allocation problem without introducing
                  additional non-convexities to the original problem. We develop
                  a distributed Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to
                  solve the optimal team composition problem. To deal with
                  non-convexity, we initialize the algorithm using a greedy
                  method and exploit the submodularity and curvature properties
                  of the coverage objective function to derive novel tighter
                  performance bound guarantees on the optimization problem
                  solution. Numerical examples are included to validate the
                  effectiveness of this approach in diverse mission space
                  configurations and different heterogeneous multi-agent
                  collections. Comparative results obtained using a commercial
                  mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem solver demonstrate
                  both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the
                  distributed PGA algorithm.},

  volume =       1,
  abstract =     {This paper presents a new global matching framework for stereo
                  computation. In this framework, the second view is first
                  predicted from the reference view using the depth information.
                  A global match measure is then defined as the similarity
                  function between the predicted image and the actual image.
                  Stereo computation is converted into a search problem where
                  the goal is to find the depth map that maximizes the global
                  match measure. The major advantage of this framework is that
                  the global visibility constraint is inherently enforced in the
                  computation. This paper explores several key components of
                  this framework including (1) three color segmentation based
                  depth representations, (2) an incremental warping algorithm
                  that dramatically reduces the computational complexity, and
                  (3) scene constraints such as the smoothness constraint and
                  the color similarity constraint. Experimental results using
                  different types of depth representations are presented. The
                  quality of the computed depth maps is demonstrated through
                  image-based rendering from new viewpoints},

                  tracking multiple objects. There are two major contribution:
                  The modeling of multiple objects as object stacks or
                  configurations and the hierarchical sampling scheme for such
                  configurations. Configurations in the sense of this paper are
                  collections of model parameters for multiple object. On one
                  side, this allows to model not only the behaviour of
                  individual objects, e.g. motion but also the behaviour of
                  object groups, in particular addition and deletion of objects.
                  On the other side, stacking multiple objects together
                  increases the problem search space exponentially. In order to
                  overcome the severe computational problems arising from the
                  increased search space, the paper introduces a hierarchical
                  sampling algorithm. In principle, the configurations are
                  broken into sub-configurations according to a subdivison of
                  the image in non-overlapping regions. This smaller
                  sub-configurations are than localy sampled before reassigned
                  to global configurations and propagated globally.}

  abstract =     {The final goal for many visual surveillance systems is
                  automatic understanding of events in a site. Higher level
                  processing on video data requires certain lower level vision
                  tasks to be performed. One of these tasks is the segmentation
                  of video data into regions that correspond to objects in the
                  scene. Issues such as automation, noise robustness,
                  adaptation, and accuracy of the model must be addressed.
                  Current background modeling techniques use heuristics to build
                  a representation of the background, while it would be
                  desirable to obtain the background model automatically. In
                  order to increase the accuracy of modeling it needs to adapt
                  to different parts of the same scene and finally the model has
                  to be robust to noise. The building block of the model
                  representation used in this paper is multivariate
                  non-parametric kernel density estimation which builds a
                  statistical model for the background of the video scene based
                  on the probability density function of its pixels. A post
                  processing step is applied to the background model to achieve
                  the spatial consistency of the foreground objects.},

  abstract =     {To operate successfully in indoor environments, mobile robots
                  must be able to localize themselves. Most current localization
                  algorithms lack flexibility, autonomy, and often optimality,
                  since they rely on a human to determine what aspects of the
                  sensor data to use in localization (e.g., what landmarks to
                  use). This paper describes a learning algorithm, called BaLL,
                  that enables mobile robots to learn what features/landmarks
                  are best suited for localization, and also to train artificial
                  neural networks for extracting them from the sensor data. A
                  rigorous Bayesian analysis of probabilistic localization is
                  presented, which produces a rational argument for evaluating
                  features, for selecting them optimally, and for training the
                  networks that approximate the optimal solution. In a
                  systematic experimental study, BaLL outperforms two other
                  recent approaches to mobile robot localization.},

  abstract =     {The problem of concurrent mapping and localization has
                  received considerable attention in the mobile robotics
                  community. Existing approaches can largely be grouped into two
                  distinct paradigms: topological and metric. This paper
                  proposes a method that integrates both. It poses the mapping
                  problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and
                  devises an efficient algorithm for search in likelihood space.
                  It presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two
                  phases: a topological and a metric mapping phase. The
                  topological mapping phase solves a global position alignment
                  problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant
                  places. The subsequent metric mapping phase produces a
                  fine-grained metric map of the environment in floating-point
                  resolution. The approach is demonstrated empirically to scale
                  up to large, cyclic, and highly ambiguous environments.},

  abstract =     {Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major
                  paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and
                  topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric
                  maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and
                  problem solving in large-scale indoor environments.
                  Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more
                  efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are
                  considerably difficult to learn in large-scale environments.
                  This paper describes an approach that integrates both
                  paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are
                  learned using artificial neural networks and Bayesian
                  integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the
                  grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent
                  regions. By combining both paradigms?rid-based and
                  topological? the approach presented here gains the best of
                  both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper
                  gives results for autonomously operating a mobile robot
                  equipped with sonar sensors in populated multi-room

                  produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments:
                  grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce

                  maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale

                  Markov random fields. The alignment of local maps into a
                  single global maps is achieved by a tree-based algorithm for
                  searching similar-looking local landmark configurations,
                  paired with a hill climbing algorithm that maximizes the

                  concurrent mapping and localization problem that arises in
                  mobile robotics. The algorithm addresses the problem in which
                  a team of robots builds a map online, while simultaneously
                  accommodating errors in their odometry. At the core of the
                  algorithm is a technique that combines fast maximum likelihood
                  map growing with a Monte Carlo localizer that uses particle
                  representations. The combination of both yields an online
                  algorithm that can cope with large odometric errors typically
                  found when mapping environments with cycles. The algorithm can
                  be implemented distributedly on multiple robot platforms,
                  enabling a team of robots to cooperatively generate a single
                  map of their environment. Finally, an extension is described
                  for acquiring three-dimensional maps, which capture the
                  structure and visual appearance of indoor environments in 3D.},

  abstract =     {This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous
                  mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem
                  of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile
                  robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates an
                  algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended
                  information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the
                  information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small
                  number of links that tie together nearby features in the map.
                  This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF,
                  called the sparse extended information filters (SEIF). SEIFs
                  represent maps by graphical networks of features that are
                  locally interconnected, where links represent relative
                  information between pairs of nearby features, as well as
                  information about the robot? pose relative to the map. We show
                  that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed
                  in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also
                  provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set
                  collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot

                  foreground when we detect background for a fixed camera view
                  by using mixture of Gaussians models and multiple cues. The
                  background is modeled by three Gaussian mixtures as in the
                  work of Stauffer and Grimson. Then the intensity and texture
                  information are integrated to remove shadows and to enable the
                  algorithm working for quick lighting changes. For foreground
                  analysis, the same Gaussian mixture model is employed to
                  detect the static foreground regions without using any
                  tracking or motion information. Then the whole static regions
                  are pushed back to the background model to avoid a common
                  problem in background subtraction - fragmentation (one object
                  becomes multiple parts). The method was tested on our real
                  time video surveillance system. It is robust and run about 130
                  fps for color images and 150 fps for grayscale images at size

  abstract =     {Field-of-view (FOV) restrictions are known to affect human
                  behaviour and to degrade performance for a range of different
                  tasks. However, the relationship between human locomotion
                  performance in complex environments and FOV size is currently
                  not fully known. This paper examined the effects of FOV
                  restrictions on the performance of participants manoeuvring
                  through an obstacle course with horizontal and vertical
                  barriers. All FOV restrictions tested (the horizontal FOV was
                  either 30? 75?or 120? while the vertical FOV was always 48?
                  significantly reduced performance compared to the unrestricted
                  condition. Both the time and the number of footsteps needed to
                  traverse the entire obstacle course increased with a
                  decreasing FOV size. The relationship between FOV restriction
                  and manoeuvring performance that was determined can be used to
                  formulate requirements for FOV restricting devices that are

  abstract =     {This paper presents a method of 3-D SLAM using a single
                  camera. We utilize a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF)
                  to deal with a large number of landmarks. A difficulty in
                  monocular SLAM is robustness to outliers and noise, which may
                  cause false estimates especially under short baseline
                  conditions. We propose an exhaustive pose-space search that
                  finds all the plausible hypotheses efficiently using epipolar
                  geometry. The obtained pose hypotheses are refined by the

  abstract =     {Human interaction with a service robot requires a shared
                  representation of the environment for spoken dialogue and task
                  specification where names used for particular locations are
                  depending on personal preferences. A question is how such
                  human oriented models can be tied to the geometric robotic
                  models needed for precise localisation and navigation. We
                  assume that this integration can be based on the information
                  potential users give to a service robot about its working
                  environment. We further believe that this information is best
                  given in an interactive setting (a "guided tour") in this
                  particular environment. This paper presents a pilot study that
                  investigates how humans present a familiar environment to a
                  mobile robot. The study is set up within our concept of Human
                  Augmented Mapping, for which we assume an initial "guided
                  tour" scenario to teach a robot its environment. Results from
                  this pilot study are used to validate a proposed generic
                  environment model for a service robot.},

  abstract =     {Service robots designed for domestic settings need to navigate
                  in an environment that they have to share with their users.
                  Thus, they have to be able to report their current state and
                  whereabouts in a way that is comprehensible for the user. Pure
                  metric maps do not usually correspond to the understanding of
                  the environment a user would provide. Thus, the robotic map
                  needs to be integrated with the human representation. This
                  paper describes our framework of Human Augmented Mapping that
                  allows us to achieve this integration.We propose further a
                  method to specify and represent regions that relate to a user?
                  view on the environment. We assume an interactive setup for
                  the specification of regions and show the applicability of our
                  method in terms of distinctiveness for space segmentation and

                  surveillance systems. We develop Wallflower, a three-component
                  system for background maintenance: the pixel-level component
                  performs Wiener filtering to make probabilistic predictions of
                  the expected background; the region-level component fills in
                  homogeneous regions of foreground objects; and the frame-level
                  component detects sudden, global changes in the image and
                  swaps in better approximations of the background. We compare
                  our system with 8 other background subtraction algorithms.
                  Wallflower is shown to outperform previous algorithms by
                  handling a greater set of the difficult situations that can
                  occur. Finally, we analyze the experimental results and
                  propose normative principles for background maintenance.},

  abstract =     {Recently, the acquisition of three-dimensional maps has become
                  more and more popular. This is motivated by the fact that
                  robots act in the three-dimensional world and several tasks
                  such as path planning or localizing objects can be carried out
                  more reliable using three-dimensional representations. In this
                  paper we consider the problem of extracting planes from
                  three-dimensional range data. In contrast to previous
                  approaches our algorithm uses a hierarchical variant of the
                  popular Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to
                  simultaneously learn the main directions of the planar
                  structures. These main directions are then used to correct the
                  position and orientation of planes. In practical experiments
                  carried out with real data and in simulations we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm can accurately extract planes and their
                  orientation from range data.},

                  adjustment is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction

                  estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of cost function

                  recursive methods; gauge (datum) invariance; and quality

                  vision system for the control of a mobile robot in a dynamic
                  environment. The complexity of our robot architecture arises
                  from the wide variety of tasks that need to be performed and
                  the resulting challenge of coordinating multiple distributed,
                  concurrent processes on a diverse range of processor
                  architectures, including transputers, digital signal
                  processors and a workstation host. The system handles the
                  sensing, reasoning and action components of a robot,
                  distributed over these architectures, and responds to
                  unpredictable events in an unknown dynamic environment.
                  Spinoza relies heavily on its capability to perform real-time
                  vision processing in order to perform task such as mapping,

                  basic, and subordinate level in the categorization of scenes.
                  Their goal is to build a taxonomy for scene categories and to
                  identify the basic or preferred level of categorization for
                  scenes. They carry out a set of psychophysical experiments
                  which result in a taxonomy of environmental scenes. Their
                  research indicates that knowledge about scenes has a
                  hierarchical organization with an intermediate or
                  {\textbackslash}emphbasic level. In addition, the experiments
                  reveal attributes, activities, and parts for each category,

                  or their combinations (either parallel or sequential comb.)
                  Examples of elementary visual routines are : 1. Shift of the
                  processing or focus (just apply particular operation to some
                  region). 2. Indexing (the region to which the operation will
                  be applied is indexed by some distinctive feature). 3. Bouded
                  activation (operation is applied over surface or boundary
                  stopping at discontinuities). 4. Boundary tracing (tracing a
                  single contour or number of contours) 5. Marking (operation of
                  marking a location - means location was remembered and the

  abstract =     {This paper examines the processing of visual information
                  beyond the creation of the early represcntations. A
                  fundamental requirement at this level is the capacity to
                  establish visually abstract shape properties and spatial
                  relations. This capacity plays a major role in object
                  recognition, visually guided manipulation, and more abstract
                  visual thinking. For the human visual system, the perception
                  of spatial properties and relations that are complex from a
                  computational standpoint, nevertheless often appears immediate
                  and effortless. This apparent immediateness and ease of
                  perceiving spatial relations is, however, deceiving. It
                  conceals in fact a complex array of processes highly
                  specialized for the task. The proficiency of the human system
                  in analyzing spalial information far surpasses the capacities
                  of current artificial systems. The study of the computations
                  that underlie this competence may therefore lead to the
                  development of new more efficient processors for the spatial
                  analysis of visual information. It is suggested that the
                  perception of spatial relations is achieved by the application
                  to the base representations of visual routines that are
                  composed of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for
                  different properties and relations share elemental operations.
                  Using a fixed set of basic operations, the visual system can
                  assemble different routines to extract an unbounded variety of
                  shape properties and spatial relations. At a more detailed
                  level, a number of plausible basic operations are suggested,
                  based primarily on their potential usefulness, and supported
                  in part by empirical evidence. The operations discussed
                  include shifting of the processing focus, indexing to an
                  odd-man-out location, bounded activation, boundary tracing,
                  and marking. The problem of assembling such elemental
                  operations into meaningful visual routines is discussed
                  briefly.},

                  indoors and one outdoors. In all eight cases, the system

                  develop collaborative robots that can safely share their
                  workspace with human coworkers. While there are working
                  solutions to protect humans from damages induced by the body
                  of the robot there are still challenges in the field of tool
                  and work piece safety. When these challenges are completed one
                  of the next steps will be to enable these currently spatial
                  static robots to move freely in their working environment by
                  mounting them to a mobile platform. In the context of future
                  factories this enables new use cases and automatization
                  scenarios that are not possible today. This paper shows
                  several of these future use cases by systematically evaluating
                  current factory structures and deducting areas for mobile
                  robot support. To verify the theoretical results, several
                  interviews with representatives of German companies in
                  different market branches have been conducted and evaluated in
                  the course of this publication. This paper is the basic work

                  future factories. The outlook describes further steps in the

                  led to a hierarchical organization of 11 categories. The
                  authors simplify this hierarchy into multiple binary
                  classifications: indoor vs. outdoor, outdoor into city vs.
                  landscape, landscape into sunset vs. mountain/forest,
                  mountain/forest into mountain vs. forest. For the
                  classification they employ a Bayesian framework and vector
                  quantization. In this work, the authors implement only the
                  city vs. landscape classification and landscape into
                  sunset/forest/mountain classes. Using features such as edge
                  direction histograms, color histograms, edge coherence, and
                  color coherence, they reach classification rates from 75\% to
                  93\% depending on the features and the task.}

                  using omnidirectional vision as the only sensor modality.
                  Local features are extracted from images obtained in sequence,
                  and are used both to cluster the images into nodes and to
                  detect links between the nodes. The algorithm is incremental,
                  reducing the computational requirements of the corresponding
                  batch algorithm. Experimental results in a complex, indoor
                  environment show that the algorithm produces topologically
                  correct maps, closing loops without suffering from perceptual
                  aliasing or false links. Robustness to lighting variations was
                  further demonstrated by building correct maps from combined
                  multiple datasets collected over a period of 2 months.},

  abstract =     {Robots are rapidly evolving from factory workhorses to
                  robot-companions. The future of robots, as our companions, is
                  highly dependent on their abilities to understand, interpret
                  and represent the environment in an efficient and consistent
                  fashion, in a way that is comprehensible to humans. This paper
                  is oriented in this direction. It suggests a hierarchical
                  probabilistic representation of space that is based on
                  objects. A global topological representation of places with
                  object graphs serving as local maps is suggested. Experiments
                  on place classification and place recognition are also
                  reported in order to demonstrate the applicability of such a
                  representation in the context of understanding space and
                  thereby performing spatial cognition. Further, relevant
                  results from user studies validating the proposed
                  representation are also reported. Thus the theme of the work
                  is representation for spatial cognition.},

  abstract =     {Geometric representations of the environment play an important
                  role in mobile robotics as they support various tasks such as
                  motion control and accurate localization. Popular approaches
                  to represent the geometric features of an environment are
                  occupancy grids or line models. Whereas occupancy grids
                  require a huge amount of memory and therefore do not scale
                  well with the size of the environment, line models are unable
                  to correctly represent corners or connections between objects.
                  In this paper we present an algorithm that learns sets of
                  polylines from laser range scans. Starting with an initial set
                  of polylines generated from the range scans it iteratively
                  optimizes these polylines using the Bayesian Information
                  Criterion. During the optimization process our algorithm
                  utilizes information about the angles between line segments
                  extracted from the original range scans. We present
                  experiments illustrating that our algorithm is able to learn
                  accurate and highly compact polyline maps from laser range
                  data obtained with mobile robots.},

  abstract =     {Collaborative robotics is an umbrella term that conveys the
                  general idea of proximity between machines and humans for some
                  useful tasks in a shared space, with a range of options for
                  timing (continuously, synchronously, alternately, etc.). While
                  this type of human robot interaction is fairly common in many
                  fields of robotics, this survey is dedicated to the technology
                  and situations that are typical of industrial applications.
                  The current state-of-the-art in collaborative robotics for
                  industrial applications is the result of a long legacy of
                  research and development in actuation principles and
                  mechanisms from 2000s onward, together with an abundant
                  literature about improving control performances, intuitive
                  interaction modes, and perception with sensors. Safety
                  technology and standardization is discussed according to the
                  principles of risk estimation and the typical strategies for
                  risk reduction that are suitable for different classes of
                  robot systems are used in collaborative applications. The
                  organization of applications (planning, role assignment,
                  optimization of resources) has a major impact on both the
                  quality and the safety of collaborative robotics solutions,
                  with most of the literature focused on investigating those
                  performance metrics that combine human factors and production
                  figures. The survey is intended to delineate an interpretation
                  key for the design of collaborative robotics solution that
                  explains the relationship among all relevant factors:
                  actuation, control, safety, physical interaction, usability,

                  egocentric and allocentric reference frames interact?},
  volume =       19,
  abstract =     {Spatial navigation in the presence of gravity restricts one's
                  displacement to two-dimensional (2D) planes. Therefore,
                  self-motion only includes translations and yaw rotations. In
                  contrast, in weightlessness, one can translate and turn in any
                  direction. In the first experiment, we compared the ability to
                  memorize a virtual three-dimensional (3D) maze after passive
                  exploration in three self-motion conditions, each using a
                  different set of rotations for turning. Subjects indicated
                  which pathway they traversed among four successive corridors
                  presented from an outside perspective. Results showed that
                  exploring in the terrestrial condition (including only yaw
                  rotations, the viewer's virtual body remaining upright)
                  allowed better recognition of the corridor than in the
                  weightless condition (which included pitch and yaw rotations
                  according to the turns), particularly for more complex 3D
                  structures. The more frequently the viewer-defined
                  (egocentric) and the global environment (allocentric)
                  verticals were aligned during exploration, the more easily
                  subjects could memorize the 3D maze, suggesting that
                  simplifying the relationship between the egocentric and
                  allocentric reference frames facilitates spatial updating.
                  Nevertheless, with practice, performance in the weightless
                  condition improved whereas in the natural terrestrial
                  condition performance remained at its initial maximum,
                  indicating that the cognitive processes involved were innate
                  for this particular condition. The second experiment revealed
                  that single rotations in the terrestrial condition must be
                  performed around the body axis in order to obtain optimal
                  spatial updating performance, and that the latter is
                  independent of the conflict with gravity that might favor this
                  condition when one is actually upright. This suggests that
                  although humans can memorize 3D-structured environments their
                  innate neurocognitive functions appear to be specialized for
                  natural 2D navigation.},

  volume =       39,
  abstract =     {We propose that visual adaptation in orientation, spatial
                  frequency, and motion can be understood from the perspective
                  of optimal information transmission. The essence of the
                  proposal is that neural response properties at the system
                  level should be adjusted to the changing statistics of the
                  input so as to maximize information transmission. We show that
                  this principle accounts for several well-documented
                  psychophysical phenomena, including the tilt aftereffect,
                  change in contrast sensitivity and post-adaptation changes in
                  orientation discrimination. Adaptation can also be considered
                  on a longer time scale, in the context of tailoring response
                  properties to natural scene statistics. From the anisotropic
                  distribution of power in natural scenes, the proposal also
                  predicts differences in the contrast sensitivity function
                  across spatial frequency and orientation, including the
                  oblique effect.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for SLAM that makes
                  use of a state vector consisting of quantities that describes
                  the relative locations among features. In contrast to previous
                  relative map strategies, the new state vector is compact and
                  always consists of 2n-3 elements (in a 2-D environment) where
                  n is the number of features in the map. It is also shown that
                  the information from observations can be transformed and
                  grouped into two parts: first one containing the information
                  about the map and the second one containing the information
                  about the robot location relative to the features in the map.
                  Therefore the SLAM can be decoupled into two processes where
                  mapping uses the first part of the transformed observation
                  vector and localization becomes a 3-dimensional estimation
                  problem. It is also shown that the information matrix of the
                  map is exactly sparse, resulting in potential computational
                  savings when an information filter is used for mapping. The
                  new decoupled SLAM algorithm is called D-SLAM and is

  abstract =     {The main contribution of this paper is the reformulation of
                  the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem for
                  mobile robots such that the mapping and localization can be
                  treated as two concurrent yet separated processes: DSLAM
                  (decoupled SLAM). It is shown that SLAM can be decoupled into
                  solving a nonlinear static estimation problem for mapping and
                  a lowdimensional dynamic estimation problem for localization.
                  The mapping problem can be solved using an Extended
                  Information Filter where the information matrix is shown to be
                  exactly sparse. A significant saving in the computational
                  effort can be achieved for large scale problems by exploiting
                  the special properties of sparse matrices. An important
                  feature of DSLAM is that the correlation among landmarks are
                  still kept and it is demonstrated that the uncertainty of the
                  map landmarks monotonically decrease. The algorithm is
                  illustrated through computer simulations and experiments.},

                  efficient three-dimensional (3-D) object segmentation
                  technique. The technique is based on the detection of edges in
                  the image. The edges can be classified as belonging to one of
                  the three categories: fold edges, semistep edges (defined
                  here), and secondary edges. The 3-D image is sliced to create
                  equidepth contours (EDCs). Three types of critical points are
                  extracted from the EDCs. A subset of the edge pixels is
                  extracted first using these critical points. The edges are
                  grown from these pixels through the application of some masks
                  proposed in this correspondence. The constraints of the masks
                  can be adjusted depending on the noise present in the image.
                  The total computational effort is small since the masks are
                  applied only over a small neighborhood of critical points
                  (edge regions). Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented
                  in parallel, as edge growing from different regions can be
                  carried out independently of each other},

  abstract =     {Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable alternative
                  for constructing high performance coding systems. In
                  particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that
                  performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In
                  this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding
                  algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the
                  min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include
                  non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decod- ing. The
                  min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented
                  as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the
                  trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the "Tanner graph".
                  With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding
                  algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but
                  suffer from an exponentially increasing com- plexity.
                  Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles
                  (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general
                  suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible
                  compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates
                  for iterative decod- ing are developed, including a
                  generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding
                  and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after
                  infinitely many decoding itera-tions.},

                  in {Robot} {Localisation} and {Mapping}},
  volume =       22,
  abstract =     {by any state estimation algorithm. Particularly in robotics,
                  it is not very well addressed. This paper introduces a
                  multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based data association
                  algorithm for the simultaneous localization and map building
                  (SLAM) problem in mobile robot navigation. The data
                  association problem is cast in a general discrete optimization
                  framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget tracking is
                  extended for SLAM using sensor location uncertainty with the
                  joint likelihood of measurements over multiple frames as the
                  objective function. Methods for feature initialization and
                  management are also integrated into the algorithm. When
                  clutter is high and features are sparse, the compatibility
                  information of features of a single measurement frame is not
                  sufficient to make effective data-association decisions, thus
                  compromising performance of single-frame-based methods.
                  However, in a multiple-measurement-frame approach, the
                  availability of more than one frame of measurement provides
                  for more effective data-association decisions to be made, as
                  consistency of measurements are looked at in several frames of
                  measurement. Simulations are conducted to verify the
                  performance gains over the conventional nearest neighbor (NN)
                  data association algorithm and the joint compatibility branch
                  and bound (JCBB) algorithm, especially in the presence of
                  varying densities of spurious measurements and dynamic
                  objects. Experimental results with ground truth are presented
                  to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed
                  data-association method in complex and large outdoor
                  environments and its effectiveness over single-frame-based NN
                  and JCBB schemes.},

                  to understand the visual control of locomotion. They transform
                  the retinal image from a simple expanding pattern of moving
                  texture elements (pure optic flow), into a complex combination
                  of translation and rotation components (retinal flow). In this
                  article we investigate whether there are measurable advantages
                  to having an active free gaze, over a static gaze or tracking
                  gaze, when steering along a winding path. We also examine
                  patterns of free gaze behavior to determine preferred gaze
                  strategies during active locomotion. Participants were asked
                  to steer along a computer-simulated textured roadway with free
                  gaze, fixed gaze, or gaze tracking the center of the roadway.
                  Deviation of position from the center of the road was recorded
                  along with their point of gaze. It was found that visually
                  tracking the middle of the road produced smaller steering
                  errors than for fixed gaze. Participants performed best at the
                  steering task when allowed to sample naturally from the road
                  ahead with free gaze. There was some variation in the gaze
                  strategies used, but sampling was predominantly of areas
                  proximal to the center of the road. These results diverge from
                  traditional models of flow analysis.},

                  SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) system after

                  locations of visual landmarks, together with a local image
                  patch. When the system becomes lost, candidate matches are

                  this method within visual SLAM: (i) we show tracking can

                  overlaps with a previouslybuilt map, and we provide a solution

                  multiple views with multiple correspondences existing between

                  into the global map of the environment, the Constrained Local
                  Submap Filter (CLSF) relies on creating an independent, local

                  interpreting their behavior. It runs at 10Hz on a standard SGI
                  Indy computer, and has performed reliably on thousands of
                  people in many different physical locations. The system uses a
                  multiclass statistical model of color and shape to obtain a 2D
                  representation of head and hands in a wide range of viewing
                  conditions. Pfinder has been successfully used in a wide range
                  of applications including wireless interfaces, video

  abstract =     {Background modeling is important for video surveillance. In
                  the paper, we present a novel background modeling algorithm
                  based on probabilistic graphic model and Gibbs Sampling. The
                  background is modeled at different resolution level by image
                  pyramids. We develop a time dependent pyramidal Markov Random
                  Field (MRF) to represent the state of foreground/background at
                  each pixel in the pyramid. Both spatial and temporal
                  constraints in the foreground labeling process are considered
                  using three kinds of links in the MRF. The probability of
                  adding/deleting a foreground object is calculated by online
                  learning algorithm and is used as prior information in
                  computing foreground label. We use Gibbs Sampling to solve the
                  MRF under the framework of Maximum A Posterior (MAP).
                  Experimental result shows that this real-time algorithm is
                  able to segment the foreground object accurately from videos
                  with clutter in the scene.},

                  part of moving objects in change detection based video
                  segmentation, this paper proposes a novel approach to the cast
                  shadow detection based on the edge and region information in
                  multiple frames. First, an initial change detection mask
                  containing moving objects and cast shadows is obtained. Then a
                  Canny edge map is generated. After that, the shadow region is
                  detected and removed through multiframe integration, edge
                  matching, and region growing. Finally, a post processing
                  procedure is used to eliminate noise and tune the boundaries
                  of the objects. Our approach can be used for video
                  segmentation in indoor environment. The experimental results
                  demonstrate its good performance.},

  abstract =     {We describe an approach to recognizing location from mobile
                  devices using image-based Web search. We demonstrate the
                  usefulness of common image search metrics applied on images
                  captured with a camera-equipped mobile device to find matching
                  images on the World Wide Web or other general-purpose
                  databases. Searching the entire Web can be computationally
                  overwhelming, so we devise a hybrid image-and-keyword
                  searching technique. First, image-search is performed over
                  images and links to their source Web pages in a database that
                  indexes only a small fraction of the Web. Then, relevant
                  keywords on these Web pages are automatically identified and
                  submitted to an existing text-based search engine (e.g.
                  Google) that indexes a much larger portion of the Web.
                  Finally, the resulting image set is filtered to retain images
                  close to the original query. It is thus possible to
                  efficiently search hundreds of millions of images that are not
                  only textually related but also visually relevant. We
                  demonstrate our approach on an application allowing users to
                  browse Web pages matching the image of a nearby location.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a novel method for recovering consistent
                  depth maps from a video sequence. We propose a bundle
                  optimization framework to address the major difficulties in
                  stereo reconstruction, such as dealing with image noise,
                  occlusions, and outliers. Different from the typical
                  multi-view stereo methods, our approach not only imposes the
                  photo-consistency constraint, but also explicitly associates
                  the geometric coherence with multiple frames in a statistical
                  way. It thus can naturally maintain the temporal coherence of
                  the recovered dense depth maps without over-smoothing. To make
                  the inference tractable, we introduce an iterative
                  optimization scheme by first initializing the disparity maps
                  using a segmentation prior and then refining the disparities
                  by means of bundle optimization. Instead of defining the
                  visibility parameters, our method implicitly models the
                  reconstruction noise as well as the probabilistic visibility.
                  After bundle optimization, we introduce an efficient
                  space-time fusion algorithm to further reduce the
                  reconstruction noise. Our automatic depth recovery is
                  evaluated using a variety of challenging video examples.},

                  localization in urban environments. Given a database of views
                  of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system
                  computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use
                  a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to
                  select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large
                  change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a
                  large percentage of matches ({\textgreater} 50\%) are not
                  correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation
                  between the query view and the reference view, is then handled
                  by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable
                  of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is
                  also accompanied by a model selection step among the
                  fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between
                  the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the
                  query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation
                  directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation
                  cannot be obtained reliably are also described. The presented
                  system is tested on the dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer
                  Vision Contest and is shown to have higher accuracy than
                  previous reported results.},

                  deal with long image sequences. It applies to a sliding window
                  of triplets of images, but unlike previous approaches, which
                  rely on point matches across three or more views, we also use
                  those points shared only by two views. This is important
                  because matches between two views are more common than those
                  across more views. The problem is formulated as a series of
                  local bundle adjustments in such a way that the estimated
                  camera motions in the whole sequence are consistent with each
                  other. Two implementations are described. The first is an
                  exact one, which, based on the observation of the sparse
                  structure of the adjustment network, embeds the optimization
                  of 3D structure parameters within the optimization of the
                  camera pose parameters. This optimization embedding
                  considerably reduces the minimization complexity. The second
                  is a mathematical procedure which transforms the original
                  problem involving both 3D structure and pose parameters into a
                  much smaller one, a minimization over just the camera? pose
                  parameters. This leads to an even higher computational gain.
                  Because we make full use of local image information, our
                  technique is more accurate than previous incremental
                  techniques, and is very close to, and considerably faster
                  than, global bundle adjustment. Experiments with both
                  synthetic and real data have been conducted to compare the
                  proposed technique with other techniques, and have shown our
                  technique to be clearly superior.},

  abstract =     {In this work we put forward a predictive trajectory planning
                  framework to help autonomous vehicles plan future
                  trajectories. We develop a partially observable Markov
                  decision process (POMDP) to model this sequential decision
                  making problem, and a deep reinforcement learning solution
                  methodology to learn high-quality policies. The POMDP model
                  utilizes driving scenarios, condensed into graphs, as inputs.
                  More specifically, an input graph contains information on the
                  history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted
                  trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other
                  vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted
                  risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe,
                  comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject
                  vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving
                  scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation
                  framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios
                  using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation
                  framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn
                  trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs
                  sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated
                  scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by
                  an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two
                  complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized
                  T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both
                  environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios
                  compared to a highway driving environment, which has been
                  mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework
                  demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as
                  long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy
                  efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven
                  trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and
                  demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a
                  statistically significant fashion in all aspects.},

  abstract =     {Statistical learning techniques and increased computational
                  power have facilitated the development of self-driving car
                  technology. However, a limiting factor has been the high
                  expense of scaling and maintaining high-definition (HD) maps.
                  These maps are a crucial backbone for many approaches to
                  self-driving technology. In response to this challenge, we
                  present an approach that fuses pre-built point cloud map data
                  with images to automatically and accurately identify static
                  landmarks such as roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Our
                  pipeline utilizes semantic segmentation of 2D images,
                  associates semantic labels with points in point cloud maps to
                  pinpoint locations in the physical world, and employs a
                  confusion matrix formulation to generate a probabilistic
                  bird\&rsquo;s-eye view semantic map from semantic point
                  clouds. The approach has been tested in an urban area with
                  different segmentation networks to generate a semantic map
                  with road features. The resulting map provides a rich context
                  of the environment that is valuable for downstream tasks such
                  as trajectory generation and intent prediction. Moreover, it
                  has the potential to be extended to the automatic generation
                  of HD maps for semantic features. The entire software pipeline
                  is implemented in the robot operating system (ROS), a widely

                  designed and used as the artificial landmark in the proposed
                  localization system. The robot localization is realized via
                  the combination of the stereo vision and laser-activated RFID
                  based on the principle of triangulation. The localization
                  system functions like an indoor GPS. Preliminary research
                  shows that the proposed system is promising to provide a

                  {Landmark} {Matching}},
  abstract =     {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for robots and
                  wearable systems such that localization accuracies of
                  centimeters can be obtained for hundreds of meters of distance
                  traveled. Existing systems have achieved approximately a 1\%
                  to 5\% localization error rate whereas our proposed system
                  achieves close to 0.1\% error rate, a ten-fold reduction.
                  Traditional visual odometry systems drift over time as the
                  frame-to-frame errors accumulate. In this paper, we propose to
                  improve visual odometry using visual landmarks in the scene.
                  First, a dynamic local landmark tracking technique is proposed
                  to track a set of local landmarks across image frames and
                  select an optimal set of tracked local landmarks for pose
                  computation. As a result, the error associated with each pose
                  computation is minimized to reduce the drift significantly.
                  Second, a global landmark based drift correction technique is
                  proposed to recognize previously visited locations and use
                  them to correct drift accumulated during motion. At each
                  visited location along the route, a set of distinctive visual
                  landmarks is automatically extracted and inserted into a
                  landmark database dynamically. We integrate the landmark based
                  approach into a navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a
                  low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased
                  robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual odometry
                  system using local and global landmarks can precisely locate a
                  user within 1 meter over 1000 meters in unknown indoor/outdoor
                  environments with challenging situations such as climbing
                  stairs, opening doors, moving foreground objects etc..},

                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) have stimulated and paved the way
                  toward the widespread introduction of Autonomous Vehicles
                  (AVs). This has opened new opportunities for smart roads,
                  intelligent traffic safety, and traveler comfort. Autonomous
                  Vehicles have become a highly popular research topic in recent
                  years because of their significant capability to reduce road
                  accidents and human injuries. This paper is an attempt to
                  survey all recent AI based techniques used to deal with major
                  functions in AVs, namely scene understanding, motion planning,
                  decision making, vehicle control, social behavior, and
                  communication. Our survey focuses solely on deep learning and

                  conventional (shallow) shallow based techniques, a subject

                  autonomous driving. Finally, this survey highlights the open

                  researchers, and public agencies, are conducting extensive
                  testing to design autonomous vehicles (AVs) algorithms that
                  will provide a complete understanding of road users,
                  specifically pedestrians. Pedestrian behavior and actions
                  determination are highly unpredictable depending on behavioral
                  beliefs, context, and socio-demographic variables. Context
                  includes everything that potentially affects one’s behavior;
                  in AVs–pedestrian interaction, context may consist of weather
                  conditions, road structure, social factors norms, and traffic
                  volume. These influencing elements, therefore, need to be
                  focused on during the development of pedestrian interaction
                  algorithms. For this purpose, the pedestrian behavior
                  questionnaire for FAVs (PBQF) is designed based on the theory
                  of planned behavior (TPB). A total of almost 1000 voluntary
                  participants completed this multilingual survey. As
                  socio-demographic values and physiological perception varies
                  with local norms, regions, and ethnicity, participants from 27
                  countries were therefore chosen to account for this variation.
                  One of the key findings of this study is the influence of
                  pedestrian attributes and the context on pedestrian behavior.
                  Pedestrian action cannot be understood without visual
                  observation of the pedestrian themselves and their context.
                  The findings showed that pedestrians build communication with
                  vehicles based on their driving styles. The vehicle’s driving
                  style leads pedestrians to think that the vehicle is
                  human-driven or autonomous. The results also revealed that
                  pedestrians use several cues to show their intention. The
                  general perception of AVs was also analyzed, and the
                  communication between AVs and pedestrians with different
                  displaying options was investigated.}},

                  in the MDP model in order to incorporate more diverse driving
                  styles. The desired, expert-like driving behavior of the
                  autonomous vehicle is obtained as follows: First, we design
                  the reward function of the corresponding MDP and determine the
                  optimal driving strategy for the autonomous vehicle using
                  reinforcement learning techniques. Second, we collect a number
                  of demonstrations from an expert driver and learn the optimal
                  driving strategy based on data using inverse reinforcement
                  learning. The unknown reward function of the expert driver is
                  approximated using a deep neural-network (DNN). We clarify and
                  validate the application of the maximum entropy principle
                  (MEP) to learn the DNN reward function, and provide the
                  necessary derivations for using the maximum entropy principle
                  to learn a parameterized feature (reward) function. Simulated
                  results demonstrate the desired driving behaviors of an
                  autonomous vehicle using both the reinforcement learning and
                  inverse reinforcement learning techniques.}},

  abstract =     {{Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have now drawn significant
                  attentions in academic and industrial research because of
                  various advantages such as safety improvement, lower energy
                  and fuel consumption, exploitation of road network, reduced
                  traffic congestion and greater mobility. In critical decision
                  making process during motion of an AV, intelligent motion
                  planning takes an important and challenging role for obstacle
                  avoidance, searching for the safest path to follow, generation
                  of suitable behavior and comfortable trajectory generation by
                  optimization while keeping road boundaries and traffic rules
                  as important concerns. An AV should also be able to decide the
                  safest behavior (such as overtaking in case of highway
                  driving) at each moment during driving. The behavior planning
                  techniques anticipate the behaviors of all traffic
                  participants; then it reasonably decides the best and safest
                  behavior for AV. For this highly challenging task, many
                  different motion and behavior planning techniques for AVs have
                  been developed over past few decades. The purpose of this
                  paper is to present an exhaustive and critical review of these
                  existing approaches on motion and behavior planning for AVs in
                  terms of their feasibility, capability in handling dynamic
                  constraints and obstacles, and optimality of motion for
                  comfort. A critical evaluation of the existing behavior
                  planning techniques highlighting their advantages, ability in
                  handling of static and dynamic obstacles, vehicle constraints
                  and limitations in operational environments has also been
                  presented.}},

  abstract =     {{Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is an important
                  function of autonomous vehicles. However, most of the current
                  state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models rely heavily on
                  map information. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the
                  existing models, our paper proposes a map-free trajectory
                  prediction model and names it TR-Pred (Trajectory Relative
                  two-stream Prediction). The trajectory stream employs LSTM to
                  embedding the trajectory information of each agent.
                  Subsequently, it utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) to
                  extract latent traffic information in the current scenario,
                  such as lane lines, drivable areas, and traffic control
                  conditions. The relative stream utilizes temporal transformer
                  to capture the local relative movement among agents.
                  Subsequently, it employs GNN to extract the interaction
                  information of all target agent. We augment the temporal
                  transformer through refine initialization of its class token.
                  This refined thereby enable enhanced modeling of inter-agent
                  relative motion correlations between the agents. The decoder
                  predicts the target agent by incorporating the historical
                  interaction information among agents with latent traffic
                  information. We validate TR-Pred on the Argoverse dataset, the
                  highD dataset and the rounD dataset. The results show that
                  TR-Pred performs better in the minimum Average Displacement
                  Error compared to the main map-base model use in 2020, 2021.
                  Experiments on Argoverse results show that our framework
                  achieves a 16.3/19.7/24.4 improvement in minADE/minFDE(minimum
                  Final Displacement Error)/MR(Miss Rate) compared to CRAT-Pred.
                  The experimental results on highD and rounD show that,
                  compared to the map-free version HiVT, our framework achieves
                  improvements of 18.8/18.8/25.0 and 8.3/8.5/7.4 in
                  minADE/minFDE/MR, respectively.}},

                  in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds
                  applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I
                  present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares
                  problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical,
                  graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use.
                  Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit
                  quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry
                  property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The
                  best translational offset is the difference between the
                  centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and
                  scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The
                  best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square
                  deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their
                  respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred
                  to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected
                  points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is
                  the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue
                  of a symmetric 4 {\texttimes} 4 matrix. The elements of this
                  matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding
                  coordinates of the points.},
