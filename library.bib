a taxonomy for scene categories and to identify the
basic or preferred level of categorization for
scenes. They carry out a set of psychophysical
experiments which result in a taxonomy of
environmental scenes. Their research indicates that
knowledge about scenes has a hierarchical
organization with an intermediate or $\backslash$emph\{basic\}

attributes, activities, and parts for each category,

abstract = {We present an approach to activity discovery, the
unsupervised identification and modeling of human
actions embedded in a larger sensor stream.
Activity discovery can be seen as the inverse of the
activity recognition problem. Rather than learn
models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to
discover motifs, sets of similar subsequences within
the raw sensor stream, without the benefit of labels
or manual segmentation. These motifs are
statistically unlikely and thus typically correspond
to important or characteristic actions within the
activity. The problem of activity discovery differs
from typical motif discovery, such as locating
protein binding sites, because of the nature of time
series data representing human activity. For
example, in activity data, motifs will tend to be
sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only
exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate
time warping. In this paper, we motivate the
activity discovery problem and present our approach
for efficient discovery of meaningful actions from
sensor data representing human activity. We
empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise
data set captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis
inertial sensor. Our algorithm successfully
discovers motifs that correspond to the real
exercises with a recall rate of 96.3 percent and
overall accuracy of 86.7 percent over six exercises
and 864 occurrences.},

The work by Oliva and Torralba is based
psychophysically on the PhD work of Aude Oliva
$\backslash$cite\{oliva00\}$\backslash$cite\{schyns94\}. Even when viewing
scenes only for a very short time period, humans are
able to extract enough visual information to
accurately recognize its categorical properties. The
authors thus use the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) and the windowed DFT in order to describe and
to learn the spatial properties of certain scene
categories. In $\backslash$cite\{oliva01\}, they learn the
degrees of naturalness, of openness, of roughness,
of expansion and of ruggedness (spatial envelope
properties) in order to sort unseen images along
these axes. In $\backslash$cite\{torralba01a\}, the DFT and the
windowed DFT are used to determine the global depth
of a scene without absolute depth measurements. In
general, the goal of the authors' work is to
generate scene-centered descriptions from the
spatial envelope properties

year, and still on-going, research program in
decentralised sensing systems. This program covers
both the theoretical development of data fusion
methods appropriate to networks of decentralised
sensors and the practical implementation of these in
both civilian and military contexts. The methods
employed for studying the decentralized data fusion
problem are based on the information-filter
formulation of the Kalman filter algorithm and on
information-theoretic methods derived from Bayes
theorem. This theory is briefly described in context
of a number of practical implementations of
decentralised data fusion methods in surveillance
and control applications. The paper describes
specific theoretical tools developed to address such
issues as; decentralised communication management,
model distribution, decentralised data association
and fault detection, sensor control (information
gathering, target cuing and hand-off), decentralised
picture compilation and map building. Finally, we
describe our current work deployment of
decentralized, large-scale systems of systems
demonstrations.},

abstract = {Recent work in the object recognition community has
yielded a class of interest-point-based features
that are stable under significant changes in scale,
viewpoint, and illumination, making them ideally
suited to landmark-based navigation. Although many
such features may be visible in a given view of the
robot's environment, only a few such features are
necessary to estimate the robot's position and
orientation. In this paper, we address the problem
of automatically selecting, from the entire set of
features visible in the robot's environment, the
minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose
the world into a small number of maximally sized
regions, such that at each position in a given
region, the same small set of features is
visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
formulation of the problem, and prove that it is
NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of
approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the
decompositions from the real image data to measure
the localization performance versus the undecomposed
map.},

for social interaction studies is presented. We are
interested in studying the impact of passage
behaviours in casual encounters. While the system
offers assistance in locating the appropriate office
that a visitor wants to reach, it is expected to
engage in a passing behaviour to allow free passage
for other persons that it may encounter. Through use
of such an approach it is possible to study the
effect of social interaction in a situation that is
much more natural than out-of-context user
studies. The system has been tested in an early
evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7
hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were
registered and 13 passage behaviors were performed
to conclude that this framework can be successfully
used for the evaluationof passing behaviors in
natural contexts of operation. },

abstract = {Since Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approaches
reached a prime of importance in interactive robot
programming, sensor technology for tracking the
user's actions and behavior is attached more and
more importance. However, traditional methods based
on single sensor system input are already at their
limits, since PbD is an application area where
real-time requirement do play an important
role. Thus, a sensor fusion approach is proposed
which serves input data for a finite state
automat. The input sources are on the one hand a
data-glove which classifies different grips and on
the other hand a movable camera head which tracks
the movements of the data glove as well as estimates
object positions. Both sensor sources use time
efficient algorithms, since sensory data must be
processed in real-time. The efficiency of this
approach is proven in a PbD environment were
flexible infusion bags are handled and respective
actions and object positions are recognized.},

experts can be a challenge due to lack of an
interaction model. The present work is based on the
rules from proxemics which are used to design a
passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral
distance of passage is a key parameter to
consider. An implemented system has been used in a
small study to verify the basic parametric design
for such a system. In total 10 subjects evaluated
variations in proxemics for encounters with a robot
in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates
that entering the intimate sphere of people is less
comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is
also considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of
avoidance is a behaviour that must be carefully
tuned. },

annote = {This paper presents a new approach for Bayesian
multi-object tracking using particle filters. Two
novelties are introduced: First, a multi-blob
likelihood function which assigns directly
comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing
different numbers of objects. Second, a Bayesian
multi-object filter which uses the abovementioned
multi-blob likelihood function as the observation
model. Using the standard machinery of particle
filters, this results in a filter which is able to
track an unknown and varying number of objects. the
paper is very well written and easily understandable
though the presented ideas are not trivial at all.},

temporally extended activity can benefit from a
detailed description of high-level expectations
about the activity. Stochastic grammars allow for an
efficient representation of such expectations and
are well-suited for the specification of temporally
well-ordered activities. In this paper, we extend
stochastic grammars by adding event parameters,
state checks, and sensitivity to an internal scene
model. We present an implemented system that uses
human-specified grammars to recognize a person
performing the Towers of Hanoi task from a video
sequence by analyzing object interaction
events. Experimental results from several videos
show robust recognition of the full task and its
constituent sub-tasks even though no appearance
models of the objects in the video are provided.
These experiments include videos of the task
performed with different shaped objects and with
distracting and extraneous interactions.},

$\backslash$cite\{barnard02\}$\backslash$cite\{barnard03\}$\backslash$cite\{barnard01a\}$\backslash$cite\{barnard01\}:
It is very important to mention the work of Barnard
et. al. in the context of automated annotation of
images and scene representation. $\backslash$cite\{barnard02\}
won the the best paper award in Cognitive Vision at
ECCV 2002. The goal of their work is to attach words
(annotations) to images and image regions. The
specialty is that they learn the joint statistics of
words and image regions from annotated training
images. After having learned the models, words can
be attached to images outside the training set
(auto-annotation). The work of Barnard et. al. is
based on methods for modeling co-occurrence data,
especially the work of Hofmann and Puzicha
$\backslash$cite\{hofmann98a\}. They developed a flat and
hierarchical models for dyadic (co-occurrence) data,
that is data that has associations of different
types (e.g. image features and image annotations).},

process by which individuals in an interaction
start, maintain and end their perceived connection
to one another. The paper reports on one aspect of
engagement among human interactors -- the effect of
tracking faces during interaction. It also describes
the architecture of a robot that can participate in
conversational collaborative interactions with
engagement gestures. Finally the paper reports on
findings of experiments with human participants who
interacted with a robot when it performed or did not
perform engagement gestures. Attention is more
frequenlty directed at the robot when it uses
engagement gestures.},

on four variables of central relevance to memory and
cognitive processing: name agreement, image
agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity. The
intercorrelations among the four measures were low,
suggesting that they are indices of different
attributes of the pictures. The concepts were
selected to provide exemplars from several widely
studied semantic categories. Sources of naming
variance, and mean familiarity and complexity of the
exemplars, differed significantly across the set of
categories investigated. The potential significance
of each of the normative variables to a number of
semantic and episodic memory tasks is discussed.},

While each robot executes it's plan the failure may occur and the the planner is reinitiated. There is a lot of planning going on which may be quite time consuming also robots are assigned priorities in the allocation phase. Is a good idea?

this paper for a monocular camera system mounted on
an underactuated wheeled mobile robot (WMR) subject
to nonholonomic motion constraints (i.e., the
camera-in-hand problem). A prerecorded image
sequence (e.g., a video) of three target points is
used to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By
comparing the target points from a stationary
reference image with the corresponding target points
in the live image and the prerecorded sequence of
images, projective geometric relationships are
exploited to construct Euclidean homographies. The
information obtained by decomposing the Euclidean
homography is used to develop a kinematic
controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to
develop an adaptive update law to actively
compensate for the lack of depth information
required for the translation error
system. Experimental results are provided to
demonstrate the control design},

abstract = {We present a new parametrization for point fea-
tures within monocular simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate
representation of un- certainty during undelayed
initialization and beyond, all within the standard
extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept is
direct parametrization of the inverse depth of
features rela- tive to the camera locations from
which they were first viewed, which produces
measurement equations with a high degree of
linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
with features over a huge range of depths, even
those that are so far from the cam- era that they
present little parallax during motion---maintaining
sufficient representative uncertainty that these
points retain the op- portunity to ``come in''
smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger
movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in
the sense that even distant features are immediately
used to improve cam- era motion estimates, acting
initially as bearing references but not permanently
labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization
remains well behaved for features at all stages of
SLAM process- ing, but has the drawback in
computational terms that each point is represented
by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard
three of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show
that once the depth estimate of a feature is
sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely
be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose
a linearity index that allows automatic detection
and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency---only
low parallax features need be maintained in inverse
depth form for long periods. We present a real-time
implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization
is validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system
featuring a hand- held single camera with no
additional sensing. Experiments show robust
operation in challenging indoor and outdoor
environments with a very large ranges of scene
depth, varied motion, and also real time 360◦ loop
closing. },

annote = {Primary reference for the CONDENSATION algorithm, a
sequential Monte Carlo method for visual
tracking. In contrast to tracking techniques based
on Kalman filter, this novel approach uses
sequential importance sampling for conditional
propagation of non-Gaussian probability
densities. After introducing the principles of
probabilistic object tracking, the authors introduce
CONDENSATION for dealing with non-Gaussian
observations in temporal image sequences. The
article concludes with several practical examples
for the strengths of particle fitlering in the
context of probabilistic object
tracking. Recommended as an entry point for
CONDENSATION/particle filter based object tracking.},

performed by a human teacher is crucial to further
processing steps in Programing by demonstration

concept of how this can be done using visual and
finger measuring sensors. As input sources serve on
the one hand a data glove which will classify
several gestures and grasps and on the other hand a
stereo camera head and a fixed ceiling camera. The
hardware used at our institute is presented just as
the technical concepts of processing and fusioning
acquired sensor information, s o called elementary
cognitive operators. All sensor sources must use
time-effici ent algorithms, since sensor data must
be processed in real-time.},

city vs. landscape, landscape into sunset

Bayesian framework and vector quantization. In this
work, the authors implement only the city

as edge direction histograms, color histograms, edge
coherence, and color coherence, they reach
classification rates from 75\% to 93\% depending on

Until know most widely used invariat in kinodynamics was time, i.e most of the cost functions were expressed in terms of time. The conclusions are that communication between agents while searching a maze is equivalent to a single agent with pebbles seraching the maze, i.e. side-effecting the environment has the same complexity as communication. Also if an automaton has an counter there exist a log-space algorithm to search the maze vs. linear time algorithms.},

before focussing on suboptimal algorithms like
extended Kalman filters and particle filters. In
contrast to the optimal methods, the suboptimal are
by far less restrictive with their constraints and
are therefore able to cope with the non-Gaussian
case. Together with $\backslash$cite\{doucet:02:a\}, this
tutorial gives a nice overview over state-of-the-art
techniques for solving the nonlinear/non-Gaussian
Bayesian tracking problem.},

effectively reduce the computational demands for a
given problem. In principle, partitioned sampling is
a statistical analogy $\backslash$emph\{hierarchical
search\}. Articulated objects are therefore suitable
in particular for this kind of (multi-)object
tracker. Besides partitioned sampling, the paper
introduces the notion of $\backslash$emph\{survival diagnostics\}
and $\backslash$emph\{survival rate\}. Both quantities can be
used for assessing the efficacy of a particle
filter. Survival diagnostic --
a.k.a. $\backslash$emph\{effective sample set size\}
$\backslash$cite\{doucet:02:a\} -- measures the effective sample
set size which has to be within the boundaries of 1
(one sample has weight 1 all others have weight 0)
and n (all samples have equal weight 1/n). The
survival rate is a property of a given sample set
meassuring the over-all tracking performance. More
technical details about partitioned sampling for
hand tracking can be found in $\backslash$cite\{isard:00:a\}.},

The application of visual routines is not botom up anymore and representations are created to meet specific computational goals. Visual routines can be viewed as elementary operations or their combinations (either parallel or sequential comb.) Examples of elementary visual routines are : 1. Shift of the processing or focus (just apply particular operation to some region). 2. Indexing (the region to which the operation will be applied is indexed by some distinctive feature). 3. Bouded activation (operation is applied over surface or boundary stopping at discontinuities). 4. Boundary tracing (tracing a single contour or number of contours) 5. Marking (operation of marking a location - means location was remembered and the processsing can return there when desirable.)},

@article{wijesoma06:_towar_multid_assig_data_assoc,
abstract = {by any state estimation algorithm. Particularly in
robotics, it is not very well addressed. This paper
introduces a multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based
data association algorithm for the simultaneous
localization and map building (SLAM) problem in
mobile robot navigation. The data association
problem is cast in a general discrete optimization
framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget
tracking is extended for SLAM using sensor location
uncertainty with the joint likelihood of
measurements over multiple frames as the objective
function. Methods for feature initialization and
management are also integrated into the
algorithm. When clutter is high and features are
sparse, the compatibility information of features of
a single measurement frame is not sufficient to make
effective data-association decisions, thus
compromising performance of single-frame-based
methods. However, in a multiple-measurement-frame
approach, the availability of more than one frame of
measurement provides for more effective
data-association decisions to be made, as
consistency of measurements are looked at in several
frames of measurement. Simulations are conducted to
verify the performance gains over the conventional
nearest neighbor (NN) data association algorithm and
the joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB)
algorithm, especially in the presence of varying
densities of spurious measurements and dynamic
objects. Experimental results with ground truth are
presented to demonstrate the practicality of the
proposed data-association method in complex and
large outdoor environments and its effectiveness
over single-frame-based NN and JCBB schemes.},

(SMC) for tracking multiple objects. There are two
major contribution: The modeling of multiple objects
as object stacks or configurations and the
hierarchical sampling scheme for such
configurations. Configurations in the sense of this
paper are collections of model parameters for
multiple object. On one side, this allows to model
not only the behaviour of individual objects,
e.g. motion but also the behaviour of object groups,
in particular addition and deletion of objects. On
the other side, stacking multiple objects together
increases the problem search space exponentially. In
order to overcome the severe computational problems
arising from the increased search space, the paper
introduces a hierarchical sampling algorithm. In
principle, the configurations are broken into
sub-configurations according to a subdivison of the
image in non-overlapping regions. This smaller
sub-configurations are than localy sampled before
reassigned to global configurations and propagated
globally.},

annote = {This paper describes a method for tracking multiple
indistinguishable objects by means of prarticle
filtering (SMCM). The two main contributions are i)
a probabilistic exclusion principle supressing
simultaneous reinforcement of mutually exclusive
object hypotheses by a single piece of evidence and
ii) a new sampling scheme - partitioned sampling -
for the applied sequential Monte Carlo method. The
probabilistic exclusion principle used as
observation model inhibits reinforcement if a piece
of data was generated by overlapping, i.e. mutually
exclusive objects. This exclusion principle prevents
the "locking" of object hypotheses on the same
object whenever two object are close or even
overlapping. Partitioned sampling increases the
efficiency of the resampling step required for
particle filtering and thus helps to overcome the
curse of dimensionality in case of high-dimensional
problem state space. The basic idea is to separate
the sampling into two steps. First, the object
hypotheses in the foreground, i.e. the hypotheses of
fully visible objects, are sampled and
propagated. Then the remaining hypotheses,
i.e. those of objects partially occluded by objects
of the first subset are processed. This approach
leads to a much better approximation of the
posterior which allows to decrease the required
number of particles.},

@inproceedings{isrr07LeonardisFidler,
abstract = {This paper presents our recently developed approach
to constructing a hierarchical representation of
visual input that aims to enable recognition and
detection of a large number of object
categories. Inspired by the principles of efficient
indexing, robust matching, and ideas of
compositionality, our approach learns a hierarchy of
spatially flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an
unsupervised, statistics-driven manner. Starting
with simple, frequent features, we learn the
statistically most significant compositions (parts
composed of parts), which consequently define the
next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer
after layer, optimally adjusting to the visual
data. Lower layers are learned in a
category-independent way to obtain complex, yet
sharable visual building blocks, which is a crucial
step towards a scalable representation. Higher
layers of the hierarchy, on the other hand, are
constructed by using specific categories, achieving
a category representation with a small number of
highly generalizable parts that gained their
structural flexibility through composition within
the hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can
be efficiently and continuously added to the system
by adding a small number of parts only in the higher
layers. The approach is demonstrated on a large
collection of images and a variety of object
categories.},

The goal of this research is semantic scene
categorization for CBIR. Through a set of
psychophysical experiments the authors identify two
main axis of human categorization: human
vs. non-human and natural vs. man-made. From these
main axis, after more experiments, a set of 20 scene
categories that seem consistent to the subjects
evolve. The subjects are asked to find attributes
and semantic descriptors for each of those
categories. In a next step these semantic features
(e.g. "busy scene") are translated to
image-processing features (e.g. "high spatial
frequencies"). The image-processing features are
used to automatically classify unseen scenes into
the semantic categories. The results are mainly
qualitatively, but quite interesting. Unfortunately,
the paper hasn't been published officially yet. I
just got a copy by the authors.},

For navigation there are two different methods. One is without a model the lines are classified as part of the model or obstacsles as the robot moves it creates a bounding polygon which represents the boundary of the free space. For model -based navigation the system given a goal builds model and then plans motions nad sensing to as the robot moves it determines it's new action based on what it sees. The simple FSM model of the navigation in the hallway was implemented and tasks like enter the second door on the left could be specified.},

annote = {Brief summary paper comparing two approaches to body
part tracking: The first approach models the
scene-specific a priori knowledge bt means of a
Bayesian network, the second approach uses particle
filtering with an exclusion principle for tracking
the body parts. Both methods are able to resolve
uncertainty stemming from ambiguities in visual data
but the Bayesian approach usually outperforms the
particle filter-based method. This is mainly due to
the more sophisticated knowledge of the scenario
represented by the Bayes network. Besides this
comparison of two methods, this paper provides also
a very short introduction/overview of Bayesian
networks.},

the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a
common orientation and spacing, but their certex
locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and
size of individual fields increase from dorsal to

modalities using Bayesian networks. In contrast to
classical cue fusion approaches using a voting
approach, continuous Bayesian modality fusion (CBMF)
combines multiple cues by reasoning about the
individual cue's reliability. Continuous global
evidence-based Bayesian modality fusion has four
main advantages: 1) Continuous sampling reflects the
complexity of Bayesian inference most
appropriately. 2) Using global evidence allows to
consider all observations from a single modality for
inference. Most voting approaches take only a single
observation per modality into consideration. 3)
Bayesian inference allows to introduce new evidence
one by one. This provides the ability to distinguish
between mandatory modalities required for object
tracking and optional modalities which give only
further hints about the presence of an
object. Furthermore, the nature of Bayesian modality
fusion allows to implement on-demand computation for
computationally expensive modalities that are only
computet selectively for disambiguating ambigous
object localization.},

In order to deal with intractability of the plannig problem we can either use powerfull parallel processing or use an conventional search space algorithm which will be swapped out in such a way that other processes will have chance to react to inputs in real time. If rules are fixed (as in production systems ) in many cases inference can be precomputed - they propose some compromise as a general purpose searching hardware for embeding planners for real-time sytems. they have the perceptions componesnts tied together in a tree like hierachy and some kind of 'mediating behaviours' which are doing mediation between behaviours.},

abstract = {The ability of human visual system to detect visual
saliency is extraordinarily fast and
reliable. However, com- putational modeling of this
basic intelligent behavior still remains a
challenge. This paper presents a simple method for
the visual saliency detection. Our model is
independent of features, categories, or other forms
of prior knowledge of the objects. By analyz- ing
the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract the
spec- tral residual of an image in spectral domain,
and propose a fast method to construct the
corresponding saliency map in spatial domain. We
test this model on both natural pictures and
artificial images such as psychological
patterns. The result indicate fast and robust
saliency detection of our method},

network s used for reasoning about the most probable
